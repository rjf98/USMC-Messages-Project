REF B IS MCO 5100.29C w/ CH-2, VOLUMES 1, 2 AND 5, THE MARINE CORPS SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.// POC1/T. HINMAN/GS-14/SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH BRACH HEAD/ CMC SAFETY DIVISION/703-571-4599/TAMI.HINMAN@USMC.MIL// POC2/S. CURTIS/GS-13/SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH MANAGER/ CMC SAFETY DIVISION/703-571-4558/SHAWN.CURTIS@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. Whether operational or recreational, the Marine Corps remains steadfast in its commitment to a culture of mitigating risk. This especially holds true during the 101 Critical Days of Summer (CDS) which occurs Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day (24 May to 1 September 2025). 2. Historically during this period, the Marine Corps loses more Marines to preventable off-duty recreational mishaps than any other time of the year as leisure travel and outdoor high-risk activities surge. 3. Over the past 5 summers, 59 Marines died in off-duty recreational mishaps with private motor vehicles (26), motorcycles (15), and water-related outings (9) being the leading activities. 4. As encouraged in reference (a), personnel must properly prepare themselves when planning for and conducting summertime activities with known elements of risk. Understanding hazards and taking action to mitigate and manage risk is a personal endeavor. Accepting or tolerating unnecessary and uncalculated risk endangers risk-takers, innocent bystanders, first responders, and those who answer the call for help. Equally important, preventable off-duty mishaps have added consequences by needlessly contributing to strain on our resources and unquestionable stress on our families, friends, and co-workers. 5. Off-duty risk mitigation training prior to commencement of the CDS period and during the permanent change of station onboarding process has proven to be an effective means for minimizing the likelihood of preventable off-duty mishaps. 6. In support of this cause and per reference (b), all Marines and Sailors shall receive documented summer safety briefings prior to each extended holiday liberty. Recommended key topics include private motor vehicle and motorcycle operation, water excursions, responsible alcohol consumption, heat illness and injury prevention, inclement weather conditions, barbecue and camp fires, fireworks, camping, trekking, and any other recreational off-duty activity that increases the probability of a mishap. 7. Commanders and leaders at all ranks have a profound impact on our readiness by inspiring individual and unit risk mitigation measures and reinforcing established safety protocols. I encourage all leaders to be creative when conducting CDS training by choosing a location that complements the significance of summertime safety and its underlying message. Both the Naval Safety Command (https://navalsafetycommand.navy.mil/Off-Duty/101-CDOS/) and your local installation safety office serve as great resources for summer safety products and information. 8. By cultivating a safety culture in which calculating and managing risk is part of the decision-making process, we enhance readiness and build strong relationships of trust through demonstrating a genuine concern for the welfare of our warfighting team. Having the courage to speak up and take action to break the cycle of events that leads to a preventable loss aligns with our warrior ethos and is a trait each of us must strive to exemplify. 9. This summer, I encourage you to have fun with family and friends, while also keeping safety and risk management an integral part of your decision-making, on and off duty. By working together, sharing knowledge, and adhering to established safety protocols, we can mitigate risks and ensure a safe and successful summer. 10. Release authorized by Lieutenant General Paul J. Rock, Jr., Director, Marine Corps Staff.//"

MARTIN/CAPT/CMC MPP-30/-/TEL: (703) 784-9875// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. In accordance with references (a) and (b), this MARADMIN establishes procedures for the FY27 Regular Colonel Continuation board and administration actions of selected officers. The primary purpose of this continuation process is to retain competent and effective commissioned officers through the selective continuation process as a means of satisfying the needs and critical skill requirements of the Marine Corps. To achieve this, the Colonel Continuation board will be conducted separately and apart from the Brigadier General Promotion Selection Board, allowing for results of Colonel Continuation to be released by MMSR-2(O) prior to the results of that promotion board. Colonels selected for continuation remain eligible for selection for Brigadier General. 1.a. Convening date and location. The FY27 Regular Colonel Continuation board will be held at 2008 Elliot Road, Quantico, VA 22134 on 10 July 2025. 2. Eligibility. Regular colonels with mandatory retirement dates (MRD) between 1 January 2026 and 31 December 2027 will be considered for continuation of active-duty service. Selected officers will be offered the opportunity to remain on active duty as specified in references (a) through (d). Colonels unsure of their MRD are encouraged to contact their local administrative center to confirm it using the MCTFS RT01 screen. 3. Board Correspondence. Officers may submit correspondence to the President of the Board via Boards and Surveys at https://www2.manpower.usmc.mil/application_cac/ or via the MMSR organizational mailbox at smb_manpower_mmsr20@usmc.mil. Information provided to the Continuation Board will not be available to any other board. 3.a. Board Correspondence Deadline. Eligible officers are personally responsible for ensuring CMC (MMSR-2(O)) has received their correspondence to the President of the Board NLT 2359 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 29 June 2025 (10 calendar days prior to the board convene date). 3.b. Board Correspondence Format. Letters to the board should be addressed to \"President, FY27 USMC Regular Colonel Continuation Board.\" Correspondence with enclosures must be submitted under a signed cover letter by the eligible officer, with the material for the board's consideration listed as enclosures. Correspondence from the eligible officer must be signed either with a pen or with a CAC digital signature. 3.c. Eligible officers are encouraged to declare their intent to accept continuation if selected to the President of the Board via Board Correspondence. However, this declaration will not be binding; once the board results are approved, every officer selected will have the opportunity to accept or decline continuation. 4. Personal responsibilities. Each officer is personally responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of their Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) and Master Brief Sheet (MBS) before the date the board convenes. As outlined in reference (e), OMPF-Records Management Application (O-RMA) is the most expeditious means of obtaining and viewing the OMPF and MBS. Officers can access the O-RMA home page to view their record at: https:(slash)(slash)www4.manpower.usmc.mil/orma/#/. 5. Notification of Selection for continuation 5.a. Regular colonels selected for continuation will receive a selection notification upon logging in to Marine Online (MOL). This notification will formally announce their selection and may be followed up with a telephonic notification as a secondary measure. Officers are encouraged to ensure their current cell phone number is included in their personal contact information within Marine Online to facilitate potential telephonic contact. 5.b. Selected colonels must communicate their intent to accept or decline the continuation offer to their monitor and MMSR-2(O) via email at smb_manpower_mmsr20@usmc.mil within 30 days of notification. The deadline for this response is 30 calendar days from the date the selection notification is displayed on MOL. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in the presumption of declination. 6. Accepting continuation 6.a. In accordance with reference (d), officers accepting continuation will be continued for 3 years for a total of 33 years of active commissioned service, or until the age of 62, whichever is earlier. 6.b. Officers who accept continuation will also incur a 2-year service obligation from the date the board is approved. This obligation will run concurrently with any other existing service obligation. 6.c. Acceptance of continuation makes officers eligible for future promotion opportunities, and, subject to existing orders and policies, permanent change of station orders, permanent change of assignment orders, or an extension of current orders. 7. Declining continuation. Officers declining continuation shall inform MMSR-2(O) no later than 30 days from notification of selection via email to smb_manpower_mmsr20@usmc.mil. Colonels who decline continuation will retain their current MRD. 8. Post-9/11 GI Bill Transfer of Education Benefits (TEB). Per reference (f), if an individual has been approved to TEB and fails to complete the associated service obligation, the amount of any transferred entitlement that is used as of the date of such failure will be treated as an overpayment of educational assistance and will be subject to collection by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). For additional questions regarding TEB benefits, contact MMOA-3 at smb_manpower_officer_programs@usmc.mil. 9. Contact information. Eligible officers should contact their career counselor through MMOA to address any concerns about continuation. 9.a. Ground Colonel Monitor Colonel Robert May Phone: (703) 784-9301 Email: robert.may@usmc.mil 9.b. Aviation Colonel Monitor Colonel Michael Blejski Phone: (703) 784-9302 Email: Michael.a.blejski@usmc.mil 10. This MARADMIN is not applicable to the Marine Corps Reserve. 11.

Memorial Day began in 1868 as a solemn tradition to decorate the graves of our Nation's fallen. It has since become a national day of remembrance \u2014 an occasion to honor the legacy of those who gave their lives in defense of freedom. Each year, we are privileged to reflect on their sacrifice and express our enduring gratitude to the heroes who fell in service to our country, and to the loved ones they left behind. Their courage secured the freedoms we enjoy today, and their memory must never fade. 2. From our founding to the present day, Americans from every generation have answered the call to serve \u2014 risking all to protect our way of life. We, as Marines, bear a special responsibility to remember the sacrifices of those who came before us. The resting places of our fallen are hallowed ground, a reminder of the valor and devotion that define our Corps. Though each fought with individual determination, they are forever united as a band of brothers and sisters \u2014 an elite company of warriors who upheld the highest traditions of honor, courage, and commitment. 3. On this Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women, across all generations, who made the ultimate sacrifice. Their actions set the standard for selflessness and valor. Let us take time to reflect on the courage of all who served \u2014 Marines, Sailors, Soldiers, Airmen, Guardians, and Coast Guardsmen \u2014 who gave their lives for the Nation. 4. Stay safe and look out for one another this holiday weekend. You are a living tribute to our fallen \u2014 carry their memory forward, and return ready to continue the mission. 5.

PIERCE/CIV/MCICOM G4/TEL: 703-571-6185/EMAIL: DWAYNE.J.PIERCE.CIV@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. Purpose. This message provides acquisition guidance and is intended to ensure proper administrative control of funds for the procurement of non-tactical vehicles (NTVs) and equipment to avoid Anti Deficiency Act (ADA) violations. 2. Background. Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics (DC I&L) Facilities Division (LF), oversees the centralized procurement of NTVs funded by Procurement, Marine Corps (PMC) appropriations (references (e) and (f)). This program is designed to minimize risk for the Marine Corps and ensure transparency in the allocation and use of NTVs and equipment as mandated by regulations. Any acquisition of equipment that could potentially be classified as an NTV (see definitions below), must be referred to a fleet manager with delegated NTV program authority before proceeding with procurement actions. 3. Definitions. NTVs, previously known as Garrison Mobile Equipment (GME), include government-owned, leased, and controlled commercial vehicles, trailers, material handling and engineering equipment designed to transport passengers or cargo for administrative operational support in a garrison environment. All DoD vehicles that are designed to operate safely on improved roadways, such as sedans, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), carryalls, vans, trucks, buses, and low-speed vehicles are considered NTVs. An NTV is a self-propelled wheeled conveyance that does not operate on rails and is designed to be operated safely on roadways principally for the administrative movement of property or passengers. NTVs do not include vehicles designed or used for military field training, combat operations, tactical purposes, or strictly off-road terrain (references (d) and (f)). NTVs are divided into four main categories: 3.A. Commercial Passenger Vehicles (CPV). CPVs are sedans, SUVs, carryalls, vans, low-speed vehicles, and buses of various sizes that are designed to be operated safely on improved roadways. 3.B. Commercial Cargo Vehicles (CCV). CCVs are general purpose vehicles such as light/medium/heavy duty cargo trucks, special duty trucks, certain firefighting apparatus, refuse collection trucks, fuel/water tanker trucks, and most types of trailers designed to transport cargo, when connected to CPVs and CCVs, over improved roadways. 3.C. Material Handling Equipment (MHE). MHE is mobile commercial equipment used to move, protect, store, or control material and containers throughout the warehousing, distribution, consumption, and disposal activities of material handling operations. This encompasses a broad range of mobile equipment designed to facilitate the efficient and effective handling of materials and containers. Examples of NTV MHE includes equipment such as forklifts, mobile cranes, platform trucks, and rough terrain container handlers. 3.D. Garrison Mobile Engineer Equipment (GMEE). GMEE is commercial construction and engineering equipment such as graders, backhoes, cranes, tracked vehicles, and other construction equipment. They support garrison facilities and road maintenance, force protection and airfield operations. 4. Responsibilities. 4.A. DC I&L (LF) is responsible for issuing guidance, centralized NTV acquisition, approving and monitoring equipment allowances, ensuring NTV inventory accountability, and compliance with federal fleet management and safety requirements. DC I&L (LF) manages PMC funds for NTV acquisitions across the Marine Corps enterprise. 4.B. Commanders, including installation or activity commanders, commanding officers, inspector-instructors, or district directors, are responsible for all NTV assets assigned to support their command requirements. 4.B.1. The Commander will assign a single fleet manager for the management, operation, and maintenance of NTVs under their command, whether a regional command, an installation, or geographically separated USMC activity. 4.B.2. If a possible ADA violation is identified with the procurement of an NTV, the Commander will follow the ADA violation process detailed in reference (b) Chapter 3. 4.B.2.a. The Commander, within two weeks of discovery of a possible ADA violation, will initiate an initial review and prepare an initial report to be submitted through the appropriate command financial management channels. 4.B.2.b. The respective Financial Management Office at HQMC will evaluate the suspected violation report and decide the appropriate action to take, per reference (b) Chapter 3. 4.C. The assigned installation/activity fleet manager is the primary point of contact authorized to request the acquisition, assignment, transfer, and disposal of NTVs for the installation or activity. Fleet managers must submit validated/corrected Authorized Allowance Lists (AALs) and inventory reports as required or requested to DC I&L (LF). 5. Funding. 5.A. Centralized Procurement. Considering the NTV program is a centrally managed program, centralized procurement is the primary method in which DC I&L (LF) acquires all Marine Corps NTVs. Fleet Managers will provide equipment specifications to DC I&L (LF) in standardized format and characteristics, where possible, to achieve standardization and efficiency throughout the fleet. 5.A.1. Basic distinction between Expense costs, Investment costs, and Centrally Managed Program funding (i.e. PMC) is explained in reference (a), paragraph 2.1. 5.A.1.a. As previously mentioned, the Marine Corps' NTV Program is a centrally managed program which is managed by DC I&L(LF), whom has the responsibility to purchase of NTV's without regard to the purchase value or being an expense or investment. 5.A.1.b. It is understood that Commanders have some discretion with using local Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding for expense purchases, up to the investment purchase threshold (i.e. $250,000), to operate and maintain their organization. However, that local purchase discretion is not applicable to the Marine Corps NTV Program. 5.B. Local Procurement. Only DC I&L (LF) may authorize local procurement, with appropriated funds, of NTVs that are not automotive vehicles, such as trailers, MHE, and engineering equipment, if there is a benefit in doing so for the Marine Corps. 5.B.1. Commanders shall ensure that all requests for local procurement of NTVs is coordinated with the fleet manager and forwarded to DC I&L (LF) for approval prior to taking any contracting or procurement actions. When authorized, DC I&L (LF) will allocate PMC funds for that approved procurement. 5.B.2. Only PMC funds authorized by DC I&L (LF) shall be used for procurement of NTVs, including local purchases. Fleet managers shall ensure that PMC funds are awarded within the time designated by DC I&L (LF). 5.B.3. Fleet managers shall track and monitor the local procurement process and provide DC I&L (LF) a status of procurement action 30 days prior to expiration of funds. 5.C. Authorized Allowance List (AAL). The total number of NTVs, which includes government owned and leased vehicles, in use at any command may not exceed the command's AAL without authorization from DC I&L (LF). 5.D. Only centrally managed PMC funding shall be used to procure NTVs, and unauthorized local procurement of NTVs with other than PMC funds is an ADA violation per references (a), (b), (d), and (e). DC I&L (LF) will not issue United States Marine Corps (USMC) NTV registration numbers or license plates for improperly purchased NTVs, unless the ADA violation is resolved or cured, and two conditions have been met: (1) appropriate controls have been implemented to ensure that unauthorized procurements will not reoccur, and (2) MCICOM (Financial Management and Comptroller) has concurred with any proposed funding corrections after reviewing the appropriate reports and supporting documentation for an ADA investigation. NTVs added to the fleet as a result of an ADA violation being resolved or cured may be transferred to meet a greater need at another Marine Corps installation/activity. 5.E. Upon discovery of a potential ADA violation, the initial findings validated by an internal review, an in-depth and structured investigation is required per reference (b), Chapter 3. If the conclusion of an official ADA violation investigation finds that a violation occurred, the report of investigation, which includes the name(s) of the responsible individuals, will be submitted to the President through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States. Within the Department of Defense, any report that concludes an ADA violation occurred must identify one or more responsible officials. 5.F. Non-Appropriated fund (NAF) procurement of vehicles must be approved by the head of the Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) and comply with reference (g), in addition to all size, efficiency, and alternative fuel requirements from applicable NTV policies and federal fleet management regulations. 6. For advice on the proper use of funds and the NTV acquisition process, contact your local Fleet Manager (MCINCR, MCIEAST, MCIWEST, or MCIPAC). 7. This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force. 8. RELEASE AUTHORIZED BY MAJGEN J.G. WOODWORTH, ASSISTANT DEPUTY COMMANDANT, INSTALLATIONS AND LOGISTICS (FACILITIES).//"

The Commandant of the Marine Corps directs the following policy for Marines and Sailors assigned to USMC and joint commands, on the wear and purchase of body armor and PPE. This MARADMIN supersedes references (a, b, c, d, and e). PPE refers to Marine Corps approved body armor, helmets, goggles, gloves, clothing, and other gear designed to protect the wearer's body from battlefield injuries. The equipment and training information for service-approved PPE systems can be found at https:(slash)(slash)app.mcboss.usmc.mil searching via program office: PMM-154.3 and via Marine Net course # mcsppe0306 - Proper use of Personal Protective Equipment 2. Individual Marines/Sailors may not use commercial PPE in lieu of government tested, approved, and issued PPE as outlined in the product information sheets referenced in paragraph 1. Commanders are not authorized to utilize unit funds to purchase commercial PPE items that have not been approved for use by Marine Corps Systems Command. 3. Ballistic spectacles and goggles authorized for use are listed on the authorized protective eyewear list (APEL) and are compatible with the universal prescription lens carrier. While the Marine Corps will continue to issue a single spectacle and a single goggle, units may purchase other authorized ballistic eyewear on the APEL through the defense logistics agency or the post-exchange. The latest APEL can be found at: https:(slash)(slash)www.peosoldier.army.mil/equipment/ approved-eyewear-qpl/ 4. All forms of hearing protection devices are considered PPE, and the Marine Corps issues Hearing Enhancement Devices (HED) (TAMCN C01142F) and High Noise Hearing Enhancement Devices (HN-HED) (TAMCN C00142F). Commanders must ensure Marines comply with ref (f) or ref (g) for helmet configuration and ref (h) guidelines to select appropriate hearing protection devices. HEDS shall be evaluated at least twice per year for appropriate use and to replace any worn/deteriorated seals per ref (h). Commanders will consult navy medicine occupational audiologists or industrial hygienists to determine from sound pressure measurements appropriate hearing protective devices for their operational needs, ensuring Marines have the correct single or dual hearing protection when necessary. Per ref (h), the safety objective is to protect Marines' exposure to any steady-state noise having an 8-hour time-weighted average noise level greater than or equal to 85 decibels: or a single exposure to impulse and/or impact noise of 140 decibels peak or greater, regardless of duration. 5. Marine Corps Body Armor Protection Levels (APLS). 5.a. A service-level policy defining specific armor protection levels has been established with the intent of standardizing APLS, enabling commanders to tailor armor protection based on their estimate of the situation or based on guidance from service/joint/theater combatant commanders. Higher APLS provide increased ballistic protection through the addition of modular armor components, increasing the areas of coverage and/or ballistic protection. Higher APLS correspond to greater weight, increased thermal loading, and reduced mobility, thus degrading individual and unit performance over extended periods of time. 5.b. The following APLS are established and apply to all Marine Corps-issued armor systems. Read in two columns: APL Description Level 0 No body armor worn Level 1 Marine Corps-issued plate carrier with soft armor only (defeats handgun and fragmentation threats) Level 2 Marine Corps-issued plate carrier with soft armor, and front and back hard armor plates (defeats rifle and fragmentation threats) Level 3 Marine Corps-issued plate carrier with soft armor, front and back hard armor plates, and side hard armor plates (defeats rifle and fragmentation threats). Removal of the soft armor from the plate carrier compromises the ballistic protection of the issued armor systems. Soft armor must be worn in conjunction with ballistic plates in the issued plate carrier - failure to do so may result in severe bodily injury or death. There are currently two variants of ballistic plates fielded to the Fleet Marine Force: the Enhanced Small Arms Plate Insert (ESAPI) (TAMCN C30202E) and the Lightweight Plate (LWP) (TAMCN C01342F). Commanders may choose to utilize either variant based on the threat. 5.c. The Marine Corps-issued helmets authorized for operations include the Enhanced Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmet (ECVCH) (TAMCN C49942F), Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) (TAMCN C01202E), High Cut Enhanced Combat Helmet (HC ECH) (TAMCN C02222F), and the Integrated Helmet System (IHS) (TAMCN C02222F) which were designed to provide both ballistic and blunt impact protection across the full spectrum of operational environments. The helmets consist of a shell, a suspension system (pads), a retention system (chinstrap), and include other accessories such as a night vision device mounting bracket and rail systems. The ballistic protection of these systems is provided by the construction and materials of the shell. The blunt impact protection is provided by the construction, materials, and configuration of the suspension system. The suspension system must have pads in an approved configuration. In accordance with ref (f) or ref (g) the issued suspension system cannot be replaced with commercial pads. The screws in the helmet support the ballistic integrity and shall not be replaced with commercial screws. Unit leaders will ensure initial training is conducted for Marines upon issue of the helmet. Commanders shall ensure approved helmets are worn in an approved configuration. 5.d. Diving life preserver and buoyancy compensator listed in the authorized for navy use (ANU) are not authorized for ballistic protection until the configuration has been certified and approved by Marine Corps Systems Command. Commanders interested in requesting diving life preserver and buoyancy compensator for certification must follow the universal needs process. Information can be found at: https:(slash)(slash) www.cdi.marines.mil/units/cdd/universal-needs-process/ 5.e. Protective attachments may be worn with Marine Corps-issued body armor. It is impractical to establish APLS that incorporate every possible configuration in which these attachments may be worn. Commanders will designate the wear of Marine Corps approved helmets; ballistic eyewear; and groin, neck, and throat protection as required by their units' mission, the threat, and local environmental considerations. 5.f. The lightweight helmet (TAMCN C32152E) and the small arms protective body armor (stocklist-3 item of TAMCN C35012E) are only authorized for use by training command. 5.g. Ballistic protection vendor samples are not authorized for use without Marine Corps Systems Command oversight and approved safety releases for limited user evaluations. 6. Authority 6.a. Operating force commanders at the Lieutenant Colonel (O-5) level or higher are authorized to determine the required level of PPE (or APL when established) for wear by assigned personnel within the Marine Corps Systems Command approved systems. This determination will be made based on mission (including during training), unit type, threat, and environmental factors. 6.b. Combatant, Joint Task Force (JTF), and service component commanders retain the authority to prescribe the level of protection worn by all assigned personnel. In cases where combatant, JTF, and/ or service component commanders have established a required level of PPE that is more restrictive than that set by Marine Unit Commanders, Marines will adhere to the highest level. In cases where the APL is not designated, the Marine Corps service policy places the authority to designate the APL on commanders, Lieutenant Colonel (O-5) and higher. 6.c. Based on their unique mission requirements, Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) personnel may, within published MARSOC policies and subject to their commanders' approval, wear special operations command-approved special purpose body armor. 6.d. Installation commanders are authorized to use government funds to purchase commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) body armor and PPE only for use by Military Police performing law enforcement duties aboard Marine Corps installations. COTS body armor must, at a minimum, meet National Institute of Justice (NIJ)-certified level RF2 as listed on the NIJ website. Https:(slash)(slash)www.nij.gov/topics/technology/body-armor/ pages/compliant-ballistic-armor.aspx. COTS body armor purchased for installation law enforcement duty will not be worn by Marines as a substitute for Marine Corps approved body armor and PPE in a combat zone or theater of operation. 7. Marine Corps organizations that do not receive class II PPE materiel support from the Logistics Command should direct all materiel requirements to DC, IL, IP. 8. Release authorized by MajGen J. L. Morris, Assistant Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies, and Operations.//"

Purpose. To announce the creation of the Marine Corps Attack Drone Competition Program. 2. Background. On 3 January 2025, the MCADT was established as described in reference (a) as a means of enabling the Service's response to the rapid proliferation of armed first-person view (FPV) drone technology and tactics. CG TRNGCMD, as the Designated Approval Authority (DAA), has designated CO WTBn-Quantico as the Aircraft Reporting Custodian (ARC) to conduct all activities required to support MCADT operations in accordance with references (b) and (d). The MCADT will participate in the first US Military Drone Crucible Championship hosted by the United States National Drone Association (USNDA) from 30 June 2025 to 3 July 2025 in Florida, where the Marines will battle against other US military units. The Drone Crucible Championship will consist of tactical inserts and mission parameters designed to utilize the \"hunter-killer method\" of employing both sUAS and FPVs. After the July competition, the MCADT will share lessons learned to inform iterative updates to Service-level requirements to enable rapid fielding of the most lethal capabilities to Marines across the Fleet Marine Force (FMF). Simultaneously, the MCADT will finalize plans to provide intermediate and advanced armed FPV drone skills to the FMF and Total Force via the Competition-in-Arms Program (CIAP), similar to what the Marine Corps Shooting Team has done annually for many decades. Executing drone competitions in conjunction with the CIAP provides an opportunity to refine and constantly improve these new precision weapons skills to help make Marines across the FMF more lethal on the battlefield. More details will be included with the release of the FY26 CIAP MARADMIN to include specific competition dates and locations. 3. Mission. Through aggressive training and experimentation and by representing the Marine Corps in inter-service, national, and international competitions, the MCADT will rapidly accelerate armed FPV drone lessons learned from modern combat to increase our Corps' warfighting advantage. The MCADT will provide regular input to Service-level requirements and deliver intermediate and advanced armed FPV drone skills to the Total Force via the CIAP to increase individual and unit lethality. 4. MCADT Events 4.a. The MCADT will host regional competition events in FY26 in conjunction with the Marine Corps Shooting Team and the CIAP. These events will provide the opportunity to share lessons learned in armed FPV tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) to FMF units to maximize lethality and capabilities with these new systems. These events will also provide training and administrative support to units who are in the process of establishing FPV drone programs in their respective commands.

On behalf of all Marines, I want to wish every member of the U.S. military a happy Armed Forces Day. 2. The Nation celebrated the first Armed Forces Day in May 1950, one month before the beginning of the Korean War. Following passage of the National Security Act of 1947, all services were consolidated under the Department of Defense to increase cohesiveness and better confront global threats in the Cold War. Likewise, the intent behind creating Armed Forces Day was to celebrate all members of the military, bolster unity among the services, and connect the public to the large peacetime force needed to defend the Nation and its ideals. 3. Today, we celebrate our Armed Forces in the spirit of unity and jointness. We further recognize and honor those Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, Airmen, Guardians, and Coast Guardsmen who have served or are currently serving. Thank you for your commitment and service to provide the common defense of our Nation. 4. Semper Fidelis, Eric M. Smith, General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.//"

Per refs (b) and (g), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected. This includes the physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section 10206 of ref (a). Ref (a) requires written notification to the officer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable. Commanding Officers must also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of administrative action. Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation. 3.b. Adverse Screening Process. Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or potentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10) removed the names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL). 4. Retirement and Transfer. Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion. An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component. 5. Accepting and Declining Promotion. Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraph 2 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted). To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade. Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline. 6. For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-9705 or DSN 278-9705. Email inquiries may be submitted via the Officer Promotions homepage at www.Marines.mil. Email address is officerpromotions@usmc.mil. 7. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower Management Division.//"

A first class PFT is required for shipping to OCS. Pre-ship PFTs must be taken no earlier than 60 days and no later than 30 days of scheduled OCC report date when possible. Ensure information is annotated in the PFT portion of the checklist. Refer to reference (h) for OCS PFT guidance. Commands must ensure Marines' PFT information meets the requirements of reference (h), prior to submission of the checklist. Marines who do not meet the above requirements are not eligible to report to the scheduled OCC, and this will count as one attempt. If this is the second attempt to attend OCS, the Marine will be disenrolled from their respective programs. d. All \"yes\" answers to questions under the Candidate Section on the checklist that have not been previously disclosed or waived by MCRC prior to selection must include the signed applicable forms and signed detailed handwritten statements explaining events, to include supporting documents per reference (d). 11. Funding. MECEP and ECP Marines, notified of attendance to an OCC by MCRC POC, will be provided a funding letter along with additional guidance. Scheduled Marines must forward the funding letter to their parent commands for issuance of Temporary Additional Duty orders to attend OCS. Questions concerning funding should be directed to the email located in the funding letter or the Marine's DTS administrators, not MCRC.

(6), \"Comments pertaining to the Marine Reported On (MRO)'s drop from, or failure at, a school because of the MRO's unwillingness to try, cavalier attitude, or unprofessional conduct or ability to meet required standards are adverse\". The CO, OCS, is authorized to effect involuntary disenrollment for cause during any phase of the training. The CO, OCS, can recommend an OCS class outside the authorized 10-week class for E-O applicants who are dropped from OCS however, CG MCRC, is the final adjudicating official. 13. Post OCS graduation. a. After graduation from OCS, Marines will report back to their parent commands or directed duty stations. All claims for travel reimbursements must be completed within five business days upon return to parent commands or directed duty stations. ECPs, RECPs, and MCP-Rs will receive their orders for TBS prior to departing OCS to execute from their parent commands or directed duty stations and are directed to submit a TBS checklist with final OCS PFT and all signatures to MCRC POC or representative prior to OCS graduation. b. Upon verification of graduation from OCS, and receipt of a NROTC or affiliated school acceptance letter with NROTC Unit acceptance letter annotating a semester or quarter start and no later than date, as outlined in reference (d), the MCRC POC will request Manpower Enlisted Assignments (MMEA) issue Permanent Change of Station (PCS) or Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) orders for MECEPs. MECEPs who submit the two letters close to the end of the fiscal year, in the event of a government shutdown, during MCRC board season, or incorrect status codes may experience a delay in orders due to priority workload, funding restrictions or code corrections. c. Due to student seat availability at the NROTC Units, MECEP Marines must apply to three separate NROTC or affiliated schools. If the unit has availability, the Marine can apply to the college/university. NROTC and affiliated schools can be found at www.netc.navy.mil scroll down then select NROTC Schools. d. Upon submission of both letters, MECEP Marines will receive PCS or PCA orders to the NROTC or affiliated school as directed. Orders cannot be issued by MMEA if both acceptance letters are not received by MCRC or there are fewer than 90 days until the NROTC unit's no later than date for PCS orders. As many universities have moved away from hard copy acceptance letters, the official acceptance email from a school official will suffice. Ensure the acceptance letters from both the NROTC unit and the school contain the same authorized semester start time frame. Formal requests to attend the NROTC or affiliated school outside of directed semester starts per reference (d) are not authorized except for PCA moves or extenuating medical circumstances. Supporting medical documentation must be submitted for review and approval by MCRC. e. MECEPs are not authorized to initiate any PCS or PCA moves prior to being issued orders. f. MECEPs refer to references (a) and (i) for obligated service and pertinent information and ensure the Special Officer Program RELM type is used.

MECEPs are not authorized to attend any school not listed under NROTC schools or that annotate Registered Nurse (RN) option only or Navy option only on the above website. i. MECEPs are not authorized to attend graduate schools until after completion of TBS. j. MECEPs are not authorized PCS moves from their original NROTC or affiliated school without prior approval from MCRC. k. Failure to provide both the NROTC or affiliated school and NROTC Unit acceptance letters within one year of OCS graduation, will result in disenrollment from the program. l. MECEP Marines who successfully graduate OCS must provide the documents listed on the MECEP Inbound Checklist to their assigned NROTC or affiliated school upon reporting. The MECEP Inbound Checklist can be found on the MCRC website listed in paragraph 5d under General Forms. m.

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan recognized the immeasurable contributions of military spouses by designating a day in their honor. This recognition was more than a gesture, it was an acknowledgment of the vital role that spouses play in the readiness and success of our armed forces. That truth remains just as relevant today. Through every challenge, military spouses continue to thrive in an ever changing, often unpredictable way of life, offering unwavering support to their loved ones and their communities. 2. The strength of the Marine Corps is rooted in the unwavering support of our spouses, who play a critical role in ensuring the readiness and lethality of our Marines. Their resilience provides the stability our Marines need to remain focused on training, missions, and operations. Without their dedication, our force would not be as prepared or capable to meet the challenges we face, ensuring we remain ready and lethal in the defense of our Nation. 3. On Military Spouse Appreciation Day, Friday, 9 May 2025, Trish and I extend our deepest thanks to every Marine Corps and Navy spouse. Your strength, love, and dedication make our Corps stronger. Marines and Sailors, take the time to thank your spouses today and every day. 4. Semper Fidelis! Eric M. Smith, General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.//"

WISNIESKI/CIV/CMC SD/TEL: (703)604-4459/E-MAIL: DALE.WISNIESKI@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. Marines, since 1 October 2024, nine of our fellow Marines have died in motorcycle mishaps. As our service has experienced relatively low mishap numbers over the past few years, recent trends indicate a culture of noncompliance among riders. As a service, we share accountability and cannot allow this trend to continue. We must use every tool at our disposal to ensure our Marine riders are identified, trained, and mentored. 2. Reference (a) outlines motorcycle safety requirements for both unit leaders and Marine riders. All members shall familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it. 3. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Safety Division (CMC SD), is actively supporting unit leaders and individual Marines in establishing effective unit motorcycle programs. In collaboration with Manpower and Reserve Affairs, CMC SD has organized and updated a list of safety-related training and additional duty codes to streamline the reporting process and ensure accurate recording and management of completed safety training. Reference (b) offers an updated list of applicable codes, which should be utilized to update individual training records within the Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and The Marine Corps Training Information Management System (MCTIMS). 4. Per reference (c), and no later than 30 May 2025, 05/06 commanders are directed to conduct a comprehensive assessment of all Marines to better understand motorcycle ridership within the Marine Corps. This includes identifying who rides motorcycles, determining completed or required training, and verifying the status of riders' licenses/endorsements. A tasker will be sent via ETMS2 for all units to report unit's completion. 5. Commanders are to review, verify, and document each member's riding status and training records in MCTIMS/MCTFS using the updated codes from reference (b). The objective is to confirm the accuracy of both unit and individual training records. Any identified deficiencies such as missing training or licenses must be addressed promptly. 6. All Marines who ride motorcycles, regardless of their intention to ride on base, are required to report their riding activity, completed training, and license/endorsement status. Failure to report this information is subject to punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Commanding officers and officers in charge are responsible for ensuring accountability and taking appropriate action against members who fail to report their riding status. 7. We are committed to enhancing our capacity to prevent avoidable losses among Marine riders. Your leadership in training, education, and mentorship remains crucial in safeguarding our Marines. 8. Semper Fidelis, Paul J. Rock, Jr., Lieutenant General, U.S. Marine Corps, Director the Marine Corps Staff.//"

Per REF A-M, the following guidance updates Service policy and procedures to support the continued planning, execution, and sustainment of the Marine Corps Training Mission - United Arab Emirates (MCTM-UAE) and associated Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases through 2029. This MARADMIN provides updated Service-level guidance regarding personnel assignment policy, pre-deployment training requirements for inbound MCTM-UAE Marines, and procedures for requesting support from the Fleet Marine Force and supporting establishment for CONUS-based training and exercise events with the UAE Presidential Guard (PG). This MARADMIN supersedes and cancels MARADMIN 123/17. 2. Background. 2.A. MCTM-UAE is a Title 22-authorized security assistance mission executed by the Marine Corps to train and advise the UAE PG. Since April 2011, this mission has consisted of two primary components: Marine advisors assigned in-country with the PG Headquarters and with brigade-level units; and annual CONUS deployments for training (DFT) of PG units to train and exercise with Marine units at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, CA; Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center (MCMWTC), Bridgeport, CA; Camp Pendleton (CPEN), CA; and Camp Lejeune, NC (CLNC). 2.B. IAW REF A, the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) has re-committed to both components of this mission through the end of FY29, but with new limits for MCTM-UAE structure and Service support of PG CONUS DFTs. The Marine Corps will continue to be financially reimbursed for personnel assigned to MCTM-UAE and for CONUS training activities through the extension of related FMS cases with the UAE. 2.C. Changes to the manpower structure and to the design of engagements reflect an understanding that the USMC-UAE PG relationship has matured from small-unit tactical advisors to brigade-level advisors focused on task organization, unit training management, and facilitation of CONUS training events, exercises, and bilateral engagement. 2.D. Within the context of CMC planning guidance and USMC security cooperation strategy, the Marine Corps intends to transition its partnership with the UAE PG from FMS training to regular Title 10 engagement. This transition includes the off-ramp of Permanent Change of Station Orders (PCSO)-assigned Marines to the MCTM-UAE program by the end of FY29. Marines assigned to MCTM-UAE FY25-29 will assist MARCENT planners in developing an off-ramp plan and support communication of the plan to USEMB Abu Dhabi and UAE leadership. 3. Policy. 3.A. Personnel Assignment. 3.A.1. MCTM-UAE will be staffed via PCSO until the end of FY29 to provide flexibility in Marine assignments and to enhance relationships and rapport with foreign military officials. The preferred sourcing will be for two-year, accompanied orders. One-year, unaccompanied orders will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 3.A.2. PCSO require losing commands to take specific actions and provide oversight on critical pre-PCS requirements necessary to prepare and train Marines before reporting to MCTM-UAE. 3.A.3. IAW REF I, MCTM-UAE Marines, and their families, if accompanied, must be medically qualified for world-wide deployment, per standard DON medical screening processes, and subsequent in-country Department of State/U.S. Embassy (DOS/USEMB) medical authorities. 3.A.4. Upon receipt of PCSO, Marines will receive reporting instructions from the MCTM-UAE Officer in Charge (OIC) detailing the requirements for PCS and pre-PCS training. 3.A.5. In addition to traditional service component functions, the Commander of Marine Forces Central Command (COMUSMARCENT) will exercise administrative control (ADCON) of MCTM-UAE Marines to include pay, entitlements, awards, and assisting with coordination of MCTM-UAE Marines' pre-PCS requirements. 3.A.6. IAW Title 22 authorities, MCTM-UAE personnel operate under chief of mission authority and are prohibited from participating in contingency, combat, or other operations with the UAE PG. 3.B. Pre-Deployment Training for Marines Assigned to MCTM-UAE. 3.B.1. The Pre-Deployment Training Program (PTP), conducted annually for inbound MCTM-UAE Marines, will consist of three training packages: 3.B.1.A. IAW REF H, USMC-led foreign advisor training tailored to the MCTM-UAE Mission, such as the modified Marine Advisor Course (MAC). 3.B.1.B. IAW REF I, Foreign Area Counter Threat (FACT) training through the DOS Foreign Service Institute. 3.B.1.C. IAW REF M, training, as required, on the duties relating to the arrival and escort of foreign military personnel on Marine Corps installations and the policies and procedures governing the disclosure of military information to representatives of foreign governments. Completion of the following training will be at the direction of the MCTM-UAE OIC before or after arrival in UAE: 3.B.1.C.1 International Military Student Office Manager (IMSO). MCTM-UAE personnel may be called upon to act as IMSO for PG soldiers participating in USMC courses. The IMSO course is provided virtually by the Defense Security Cooperation University; contact the TECOM Security Assistance (SA) Branch to coordinate course entry. 3.B.1.C.2 Contact Officer training. MCTM-UAE personnel will on occasion act as contact officers for visiting delegations of PG. Contact officer training is always available on MARINENET (course number: FDO2CTOF01). 3.B.1.C.3 Foreign Disclosure Officer training. MCTM-UAE personnel are required to be well-versed in the subject of Foreign Disclosure. This is key to identifying and protecting information that is not releasable to international partners. FDO course is in-person and available at multiple USMC installations throughout the year. Contact the PLU CENTCOM Desk Officer for list of available times and dates. 3.B.2. Personnel in receipt of PCSO to MCTM-UAE will execute FMS case-funded Temporary Additional Duty (TAD) to identified locations for training prior to detaching from the losing command. MCTM-UAE OIC will provide coordination instructions to losing commands. 3.B.3. Temporary Duty Under Instruction (TEMINS) is not a viable option for PTP due to constraints of scheduling the required training and the requirements of the PCS cycle. 3.B.4. MARCENT will provide a line of accounting (LOA) for TAD orders to support pre-PCS training. Training and travel are FMS-case funded, via MARCENT disbursal and oversight. 3.B.5. Receipt of the 0571, Foreign Security Force (FSF) Operational Advisor Free Military Occupational Specialty (FMOS). 3.B.5.A. IAW REF H, Marines assigned to MCTM who complete the modified MAC must complete a minimum of six (6) months as a PG advisor prior to eligibility for the 0571 FMOS. 3.B.5.B. MCTM Marines who participate in other Services' or interagency advisor training in lieu of the modified MAC must receive a waiver from HQMC PP&O PLU prior to eligibility for the 0571 FMOS. 3.B.5.C. MCTM-UAE OIC is the approving authority for MCTM Marines applying for 0571 FMOS. MARCENT IPAC or the gaining IPAC of a Marine completing a MCTM tour may process the approved 0571 FMOS. 3.C. UAE PG CONUS Training and Exercise Events. 3.C.1. Background. The PG participates in CONUS-based training, exercises, and other bilateral engagement to build readiness, improve interoperability with USMC units, and to develop expeditionary competency. The Marine Corps supports these events because they align to USMC and CENTCOM security cooperation objectives and foster positive relations with a strategic regional partner. Support from the Fleet Marine Force is essential to the success of CONUS engagements with the UAE PG and to the resilience of the overall partnership. 3.C.2. IAW REF A, and in recognition of current fleet operational tempo, the CMC has approved a new limit of (4) PG CONUS DFTs per fiscal year FY25-29. Annual PG CONUS DFTs will be the following types unless otherwise requested and approved via formal message traffic to DC PP&O: 1x DFT CPEN, 1x DFT CLNC, 1x integration in Service Level Training Exercise (SLTE), 1x Mountain Warfare Training Exercise (MTX). 3.C.3. In alignment with the maturing nature of the partnership, the leaders of both forces desire a greater focus on regular bilateral exercises and interoperability engagement (Title 10 authority), while retaining the ability to conduct formal training (Title 22 authority). It is expected that the PG detachments will execute both Title 10 activity and Title 22 training with Marine units during CONUS DFTs. This requires careful planning and design of each DFT iteration to ensure appropriate identification of the authority to conduct an activity and to capture full reimbursement of USMC cost for the Title 22 training. 3.C.3.A. MARCENT, ICW PP&O PLU, will assist MCTM-UAE in determining the appropriate Title authority of a UAE PG - USMC activity where ambiguity exists. MARCORSYCOM-International Programs (MCSC-IP) and TECOM SA Branch will determine if an activity can be reimbursed by the FMS cases in REF B and C. 3.C.3.A.1. For unique training requirements that are requested by the UAE PG and not covered under current case language, case amendments may take 6 months or more to complete. 3.C.3.B. Formal Training under Title 22 authority. For CONUS DFT events that include USMC curriculum-based instruction, or a program of instruction (POI) led exclusively by Marine instructors, the UAE PG soldiers receiving training will be considered International Military Students (IMS), and they must travel on Invitational Travel Orders (ITO). Formal training from the Marine Corps to the PG is funded via the FMS case listed in REF B. Participation in a formal course at any Marine Corps unit or training institution, such as MCMWTC, or a driver course for tactical vehicles, falls within this category. 3.C.3.B.1. Throughout the planning cycle of each DFT, MCTM-UAE shall notify TECOM SA Branch of any formal training planned for execution during a PG CONUS DFT. TECOM SA Branch requires no less than 90 days prior to DFT execution to complete activity costing. USMC units instructing UAE personnel shall provide a training POI and training costs to TECOM SA Branch. TECOM SA Branch will provide the Activity Costing Worksheet (ACW) and assist unit in determination of cost. 3.C.3.B.2. Units and/or schools must have an IMSO designated when IMS on ITO are participating in a course. An IMSO is designated in writing by the unit or schoolhouse commander after completion of online training. MCTM-UAE will provide IMSOs for any unit or schoolhouse without a designated IMSO where PG students are participating in formal training. 3.C.3.C. Bilateral Training and Exercises under Title 10 authorities. For CONUS engagements or exercises during which Marines and PG soldiers are training together, or PG are training unilaterally, PG soldiers will be considered foreign visitors and will travel on an approved foreign visit request (FVR). For FY25-29, Unit Enhancement Training (UET) or participation as an exercise force during an SLTE will fall within this category. Administrative and logistic support provided to the PG will be funded via the FMS case identified in REF C. 3.C.3.C.1. Partner forces under an approved FVR must be managed by a trained and designated Contact Officer (see section 3.B.6.B above). MCTM-UAE will work with FDOs, base security, and host units to establish the escort plan for PG on USMC installations. Base commanders shall provide appropriate guidance to MCTM contact officers. 3.C.3.D. When a CONUS PG event or exercise includes both formal training and bilateral exercise, the PG soldiers participating in the formal training will be on ITOs for the duration of the event, all others will be accounted for on an approved FVR. 3.C.3.E. IAW REF M, exercise design will dictate escort requirements. MCTM-UAE and hosting units are responsible for developing an appropriate escort plan per the requirements for ITOs or FVRs. MCTM-UAE will ensure both types of escorts are planned for CONUS PG events with formal training and bilateral, or unilateral, training. 3.C.3.F. Visa applications and process will be in accordance with the separate requirements for FVR and ITO. 3.C.4. Force Sourcing for PG CONUS DFTs: 3.C.4.A. Annual Plan. NLT 30 Apr, MCTM-UAE shall publish Embassy message traffic to COMUSMARCENT articulating a consolidated feasibility-of-support (FOS) request for PG COUNUS DFTs for the following fiscal year. 3.C.4.A.1. MARCENT will review, validate, and forward the annual plan via NIPR Automated Message Handling System (AMHS) to PP&O PLU. PP&O PLU will review, endorse, and forward the validated plan to prospective force providers, supporting organizations, and host installations. PP&O POC(S) will ensure MCTM-UAE requirements are registered in the Force Management Tool (FMT). 3.C.4.A.2. PP&O PLU recommends informal coordination throughout the planning cycle between MCTM-UAE, stakeholder organizations, and the intended, or likely, force providers for each event in the annual plan. 3.C.4.B. Force sourcing and response to Annual Plan: 3.C.4.B.1. PP&O PLU requests official AMHS response to the PG CONUS DFT annual plan from MARFOR force providers and supporting establishment (TECOM, MCICOM) NLT 31 July. Force providers shall respond in the FMT concurrent to and aligned with AMHS response to PP&O PLU. 3.C.4.B.2. Force Sync Conferences (FSC) are the primary forum for adjudicating sourcing solutions to PG CONUS DFT requirements. MCTM-UAE, will send a representative to FSC, as necessary, to brief requested support and, ICW MARCENT representatives, advocate with MARFORPAC/I MEF, MARFORCOM/II MEF, MARFORRES, and MARSOC for sourcing solutions to PG CONUS DFTs. 3.C.4.B.2.A. PG CONUS DFTs will be included as sourcing requirements in the Marine Corps Bulletin (MCBUL) 3120. 3.C.4.B.3. Supporting unit requirements: A MARFOR/MEF commitment to support one of the (4) annual PG CONUS DFTs is an agreement to provide both of the following supporting units or unit detachments: 3.C.4.B.3.A. Partnering Unit. A cohesive, combat arms unit that conducts bilateral tactical training with the PG unit. The training or exercise objectives will vary by event and PG unit. 3.C.4.B.3.B. Exercise Implementation Unit (hosting unit). A unit or task-organized detachment, separate from the partner unit, that provides administrative and logistical hosting support to satisfy USMC installation requirements and all safety regulations and policies. General responsibilities include escort duties, coordinating ammunition support, coordinating target support, tactical vehicle provisioning and maintenance, line of accounting support, medical support, and range safety structure personnel. 3.C.4.B.3.B.1. The Exercise Implementation Unit or adjacent unit shall assist MCTM-UAE with range and training area reservations in the Range Facility Management Support System or other required method. 3.C.4.B.3.B.2. ICW MCTM-UAE exercise coordinators, communicate with base/installation security to ensure all requirements for foreign visitor base access are satisfied. 3.C.4.B.4. MEFs are encouraged to align/incorporate UETs to existing training events to reduce negative impacts to the Fleet Marine Force and to address partnering and coalition operations mission essential tasks (MET). 3.C.4.B.5. When these resources are under MEF control, MEFs should provide range control, ammunition storage, lodging, dining, and medical support as required and identified during the UET/MTX/SLTE planning process. 3.C.4.C. Force sourcing challenges: 3.C.4.C.1. The authority to cancel a PG CONUS DFT sourcing requirement is held by DC PP&O unless the cancellation is requested by the UAE PG via MCTM-UAE. In the latter case, PP&O POC(S) may cancel the requirement in FMT and PP&O PLU will communicate cancellation to all force provider stakeholders. 3.C.4.C.2. For the (2) annual UETs, one at CLNC and one at CPEN, if a Partnering Unit and/or an Exercise Implementation Unit cannot be sourced during the PG requested dates, the intended supporting MARFOR/MEF, ICW MARCENT and MCTM-UAE, will identify alternate supportable dates or request alternate supporting units from adjacent force providers to include MARFORRES and MARSOC. 3.C.4.C.2.A. If the PG cannot adjust to alternate dates made available and no adjacent force provider support is available, the intended supporting MARFOR/MEF Commander shall reclama the UET sourcing requirement from the MCBUL 3120 NLT 90 days prior to UET execution. 3.C.4.C.3. For the (1) annual MTX and (1) annual SLTE integration, if a Partnering Unit and/or Exercise Implementation Unit cannot be sourced during the PG requested dates, MARCENT, ICW MCTM-UAE, will work with force providers and exercise stakeholders to identify alternate dates, or alternate MTX/SLTE iterations that are supportable for PG participation. 3.C.4.C.3.A. If no solution can be found, COMUSMARCENT shall request cancellation of PG participation in MTX or SLTE via AMHS to DC PP&O NLT 90 days prior to UET execution. 3.C.4.D. Additional or Detailed Support Requests to the Annual Plan. 3.C.4.D.1. After MARFOR/MEF acceptance of the Annual Plan, MARCENT will validate and forward subordinate or detailed support request from MCTM-UAE to MARFOR/MEF force providers, info PP&O PLU. PP&O PLU will interject only in the case of non-concurrence to requested support. PP&O POC(S) will register MARCENT-validated, detailed support requests in FMT. 3.C.4.D.2. It is recommended that MARFORs and MEFs delegate DIRLAUTH between MARCENT, MCTM, and the intended supporting units for detailed planning or additional support requests subordinate to the annual plan. 3.C.4.D.3. For additional, and/or MOS-specific support requests that are deemed unsupportable by force providers, MCTM-UAE, ICW MARCENT, will consider the necessity of the support to successful completion of the DFT and determine if alternate training and exercise objectives can be accomplished. 3.C.4.E. Planning cycle events for PG CONUS DFTs will be published via AMHS or Enterprise Task Management Software Solution (ETMS2). In the case of SLTE integration, PG CONUS DFT planning cycle events will mirror set dates for Marine SLTE planning. 3.C.4.F. MCTM-UAE will provide Foreign Disclosure oversight or coordinate with CONUS FDOs to ensure products and briefs visible or provided to the UAE during planning cycle events or the execution of training or exercises are Unclassified or cleared for release to UAE. 4.

GRAY/MSGT/MCRC RTR COORDINATOR WEST TEL: 571-264-3832/ EMAIL: EARON.GRAY@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. This MARADMIN announces the Marine Corps Recruiting Command (MCRC) Recruiting Station (RS) preference incentive offered to FY27 recruiting duty volunteers. This incentive is part of a larger MCRC campaign, Recruit the Recruiter (RtR), designed to increase volunteerism and reduce the size of the Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) Special Duty Assignment Screening Team (HSST) requirement. This is a collaborative effort between MCRC and Manpower & Reserve Affairs (M&RA), Director, Manpower Management Division (MM). 2. The Recruiting Station Incentive (RSI) allows Marines to choose their preferred RS, based on availability, when they volunteer and complete the request with the unit career counselor. 3. Per ref A, qualified Marines who volunteer during the above listed timeline are guaranteed his/her available RS of choice and a FY27 school seat at Marine Corps Recruiter School. 4. Per ref A, Marines who volunteer for and successfully complete a tour of duty as a recruiter will be given a contiguous United States assignment of geographical preference unless they specifically request an overseas assignment. These Marines are authorized a duty station option to a specific geographic area. Every effort will be made to satisfy the desires of the Marine when a valid billet in their primary military occupational specialty (PMOS) exists in the requested geographic area. 5.

The purpose of this message is to solicit applicants for part-time master's degree, certificate, and continuous education opportunities through the National Intelligence University (NIU) in accordance with the references. NIU offers free Master's Degree programs, Master's certificates, and continuing education (audit) opportunities to any Marine or Marine civilian with an active Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security clearance who possess a baccalaureate degree from a U.S. college or university accredited by one of the regional accreditors recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Any change to employment or clearance status during the application period or while enrolled as a student must be reported immediately to the Office of Enrollment Management and the Office of Security as it may impact eligibility to attend. 1.a. Marines or civilians can utilize NIU's part-time program opportunities without Service sponsorship. Only the full-time program, executed via a permanent change of station move to the National Capitol Region (NCR) and coordinated via a separate MARADMIN, requires Service sponsorship. 1.b. NIU is funded by the U.S. Federal Government. This funding is overseen by the Director of National Intelligence, and ultimately approved by the Administration and Congress. The NIU does not charge tuition and does not receive funding from Department of Education grants or loans. 2. Background. 2.a. The list of all available programs and certificates is located on the NIU Academics page located at https:(slash)(slash)ni-u.edu/academics/. Contact the Marine Corps NIU Representative or Admissions Office point of contact (POC) with specific questions regarding admissions. The Marine Corps does not require applicants to obtain service approval for enrollment in part-time study programs. Part-time applicants must adhere to the Marine Corps education rules and qualifications regarding educational attendance. Prospective students may only apply to one academic program at a time. 3. Part Time Program Opportunities. 3.a. Master's Degree. Part-time master's students are expected to complete all degree requirements within 36 months. Part-time students who do not complete the requirements in four years will be contacted by the Office of Enrollment Management to discuss completion planning. 3.b. Certificate of Intelligence Studies Program. 3.b.1. Certificate students should complete their programs within two years and typically take one graduate level course over four quarters. 3.b.2. NIU offers the Certificate in Intelligence Studies in several topical areas within the Technology Intelligence, and Strategic Intelligence fields. 3.c. Continuing Education. 3.c.1. Non-degree-seeking students who wish to take courses for professional development may apply as a Continuing Education (CE) student. CE-only students should renew their applications annually to broadcast their intention to participate in enrollment activities at least one term a year. Students who subsequently convert to degree-seeking or certificate-seeking status may apply to no more than two CE courses toward a degree or certificate. Enrollment is based on eligibility criteria and availability of space in courses. 3.c.2. A student cannot graduate or receive a degree while in a non- degree-seeking status. Non-degree-seeking students must meet the same academic standards as degree-seeking students. 4. NIU Global Campus. 4.a. To meet its mandate to provide relevant, accessible, and continuous intelligence education to globally dispersed students beyond the NCR, NIU has established a global campus structured around regional academic centers. Each academic center is managed by an onsite NIU center director and offers courses taught by full-time and adjunct NIU faculty. To maximize accessibility, the academic centers work with approved instructional sites where students can participate via secure videoconference (VTC). Students physically located outside an academic center or instructional site can participate remotely but are solely responsible for ensuring they have access to a secure VTC. Not all courses can be taught through secure VTC; many require in-person enrollment via an academic center or instructional site. Students are encouraged to coordinate with the enrollment staff to verify degree, certificate, and course requirements. 4.b. The National Security Agency (NSA) Academic Center is located at NSA headquarters on Ft. Meade, Maryland, and includes an instructional site at NSA Georgia on Fort Gordon, Georgia. 4.c. The European Academic Center (EAC), located at RAF Molesworth, UK, serves students assigned overseas to U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command. With additional instructional sites in Stuttgart and Ramstein, Germany, EAC supports students throughout Europe and Africa able to attend course sessions via secure VTC. 4.d. The Southern Academic Center, located at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, primarily serves students who live and work in the vicinity of MacDill Air Force Base, but also supports students from six instructional sites: U.S. Southern Command, Hurlburt Field and Joint Interagency Task Force-South in Florida, National Air and Space Intelligence Center in Ohio, Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, and Fort Bragg in North Carolina. 4.e. The Quantico Academic Center (QAC), located at the Federal Bureau of Investigations Academy Intelligence and Investigative Training Center, primarily serves students who live and work in the vicinity of Marine Corps Base Quantico but also support students at Rivanna Station Charlottesville, VA. NIU is looking to expand to additional U.S. Marine bases across the Continental United States. 4.e.1. The QAC provides part-time, evening graduate study to qualified military and Federal civil service personnel who hold active TS/SCI clearances and who are looking to earn a Master of Science of Strategic Intelligence (MSSI), Master of Science and Technology Intelligence (MSTI), or a Certificate in Intelligence Studies in Counterintelligence. Classes are held in-person in Quantico and via secure VTC to NIU Main Campus. Classes operate Monday through Thursday from 1800 to 2040 during the ten-week fall, winter, spring, and summer quarters. Instruction is provided in- person by QAC faculty and augmented by Quantico's adjunct faculty or via VTC by NIU Main Campus faculty. 5. Service Obligation. There is no service obligation to attend NIU under any of the part-time opportunities listed in paragraph 3. 6. Application requirements and procedures for all programs. 6.a. Each applicant must submit an online NIU application but their first enrollment will not happen until fall or spring quarter. The NIU academic calendar is located at https:(slash)(slash)ni-u.edu/academic-calendar/ for reference to AY quarter start dates. The most up-to-date information on how to apply is located at https:(slash)(slash)www.ni-u.edu/apply-now-for-all-academic-programs/. 6.a.1. Applicants submit one application at a time for the requested program of study. 6.a.2. Acceptance of the application does not guarantee enrollment into the desired program of study. Enrollment is based on academic eligibility and space available. 6.b. MSSI and MSTI applicants are carefully evaluated regarding previous education, academic preparation, and proven ability to excel in graduate work. Graduate degree applicants must submit an application form, official transcripts for all completed degrees, two letters of recommendation, statement of purpose and resum\u00e9 by the published deadline. Graduate Record Examination scores are optional and not required. Please refer to NIU's Admissions website for specific information on these requirements. 6.c. Applicants enrolling in any of NIU's part-time programs must possess a baccalaureate degree from a US college or university that is accredited by an institution recognized by the CHEA. Foreign transcripts must be submitted with an official transcript evaluation from an approved foreign credential evaluation service. Please refer to NIU's Admissions website NIU catalog for specific information on these requirements at https:(slash)(slash)ni-u.edu/Admissions. 6.d. Applicants are responsible for requesting their official transcripts and test scores be sent directly to NIU from the issuing entity. Unofficial transcripts or test scores are not accepted. Official transcripts must be delivered by mail in a sealed, stamped envelope with the seal or other security feature intact or sent electronically from a secure site formally linked to the sending institution. 6.e. NIU Admissions will not process any application without a signed participation agreement, all official transcripts, and completion of the online applications step. If additional paperwork is required, NIU Admissions Office will contact the applicant directly. 7. All students must have a current/active TS/SCI clearance maintained by the Marine Corps. The NIU Office of Security can be reached at 301-243-2097 and niu_security@niu.odni.gov with any questions. Clearances need to be current and maintained for the duration of enrollment at NIU. 8. All degree requirements must be completed within seven years. Time-to-degree begins with the earliest course to be applied toward the degree, to include credits transferred from other institutions. Work undertaken more than seven years earlier may not be applied toward degree requirements without NIU Dean-level approval. 9. The Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security (OUSD(I&S)) based on OUSD(I&S) memorandum 25 Aug 23, highly encourages intelligence leaders to enable, to the extent authorized by applicable personnel laws and regulations, up to 8 hours of duty time during the regularly scheduled work week for civilian employees enrolled in the NIU part-time programs to attend classes during duty hours. Such accommodations may be considered for both full- and part-time employees, being mindful of our hours-of-work and premium pay policies. Similar consideration should be afforded to active- duty Marines, to the extent consistent with mission requirements and service-specific regulations but must be approved by the first O-5 in the applicant's change of command. 10. This Marine administrative message is applicable to Active and Reserve Marines & Marine Corps Civilians that meet the stated program requirements. 11. Release authorized by Lieutenant General M. G. Carter, Deputy Commandant For Information.//"

Purpose: This message outlines the process for handling government-issued Personal Identity Verification (PIV) compliance ID cards (Common Access Cards - CAC), logical access tokens (DOD-issued Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates), and other multi-factor authentication tokens provided to personnel in both the original and Department of Defense (DOD) reopened versions of the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP). This process includes the deactivation and return of these credentials to ensure compliance with federal regulations and maintain access to government benefits and resources during the personnel's transition period. Additionally, this message provides guidance on managing Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) access and accounts (both MCEN-N (unclassified) and MCEN-S (classified)) for civilian personnel in the DRP. 2. Situation 2.a. Background. The DRP allows eligible personnel to resign from service while maintaining their affiliation with the Department of Defense (DoD) until their official end-of-service date or 30 September 2025, whichever comes first. During this transition period, personnel retain their DoD affiliation, including access to certain benefits and privileges. However, all personnel in this program must adhere to DoD regulations, including those governing the management of government-issued credentials. 2.b. As DRP-approved Marine Corps civilians transition out of government service, all associated authorized and privileged logical access, including access to the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) and related user accounts, must be revoked. Failure to promptly disable and remove these accounts poses cybersecurity risks and incurs unnecessary financial costs. 3. Action 3.a. Personal Identity Verification (PIV) compliance ID cards (Common Access Cards - CAC). 3.b. DRP Personnel will retain their CAC as a DOD affiliate for identity proofing for benefits per reference (a) until their official end of service or 30 September 2025, whichever occurs first. 3.c. At end of service, DRP personnel are responsible to return the CAC to nearest RAPIDS site in person or via mail. RAPIDS site information may be found at Identity Card Office Online (IDCO) https:(slash)(slash)idco.dmdc.osd.mil/idco. 3.d. During the delayed resignation period, all management of the CAC, to include re-issuance and replacement, will follow the policy outlined in reference (a). 3.e. Marine Corps Logical Access Tokens and Multi-functional Authentication (MFA) Devices. 3.f. DRP Personnel will surrender at checkout of command all Service issued logical access only (non-CAC) credentials including, but not limited, to Alternate Logon Tokens (AltToken), NIPRNET Enterprise Alternate Logon System (NEATS) Tokens, SIPRNET Tokens (SIPRToken) and Yubikeys in accordance with reference (b). 3.g. At the end of the service, DRP personnel retain any authentication credentials associated with non-civilian personnel categories, such as DSLogon, which are used for logical access only. 3.h. Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) Access and Accounts (MCEN-N and MCEN-S): 3.i. In accordance with reference (c), no later than 24 hours after completing DRP out-processing from associated Marine Corps Commands, or immediately for personnel who have already departed, all Marine Corps Commands and organizations must take the following actions for civilian personnel under their authority who are approved for the DRP and departing active service: 3.j. Account Disablement Request. For each civilian employee departing under the DRP, the owning Marine Corps Commands and organizations will submit a separate MCEN-N Remedy Change User Service Request for each NIPRNet and SIPRNet authorized and privileged user account. The employee's DRP Final Separation Agreement must be uploaded to the user's Remedy People Record alongside the service request for auditing purposes. 3.k. Account Disablement. Using the justification reason of \"EAS (End of Active Service),\" set the EAS value to the date when the employee begins Administrative Leave, as specified in the DRP Final Separation Agreement. 3.l. Extension Attribute 12 (EA12) Designator Assignment. Modify the user's Active Directory Extension Attribute 12 (EA12) to \"Designator 1\" (Legal/Medical/FOIA Hold), in accordance with reference (d). 3.m. Account Expiration Set the account expiration date to the final date of service (for example, 30 September 2025, or an alternate retirement date). 3.n. Account Detail Entry. In the service request's \"Provide Additional Details\" block, enter the following note: \"DRP employee\u2014 disable the associated user account on the EAS date. Do not deprovision or delete until the final separation date, as indicated in the account expiration date block of this request. This annotation supersedes the IC4 Waiver requirement specified in HQMC DCI IC4/ICC CY Memorandum: Update to Extension Attribute 12 Implementation Criteria.\" 4. All questions should be directed to the designated points of contact listed in this MARADMIN. 5. Release authorized by Lieutenant General M. G. Carter, Headquarters Marine Corps, Deputy Commandant for Information.//"

This MARADMIN provides Marines, civilians serving with Marines, and their families conducting a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) move from the issue date of this MARADMIN through the peak moving season (15 May through 31 August 2025) and beyond with information on how to ship and store personal property and execute government travel as effectively and efficiently as possible using the Defense Transportation System, Defense Personal Property System (DPS) or the Global Household Goods Contract's (GHC) Milmove and HomeSafe Connect. Personal property is defined as household goods (HHG), unaccompanied baggage (UB), mobile homes and privately owned vehicles (POVs). This peak moving season will be a blended or \"hybrid\" peak moving season while the deployment of the GHC continues throughout the Continental United Sates (CONUS). Many of the processes identified for DPS are very similar for the GHC MilMove system and will be annotated DPS/GHC at the beginning of the paragraph. Otherwise, note the differences as they apply to each system as DPS, DPS/GHC or GHC for paragraphs 1 through 6. Please note that civilian PCS entitlements and allowances are similar with certain exceptions for weight allowance (18k pounds), number of days authorized for Storage in Transit and personally procured moves must be listed in the orders as a move option. This MARADMIN speaks to those processes that are commonly reflected between the two groups of movers (uniformed service members and civilian employees). 1.a. Commanders at all levels will ensure every Marine with PCS Orders is provided a copy of this MARADMIN. 1.b. The Global Household Goods Contract (GHC) was awarded to HomeSafe Alliance LLC (HomeSafe) and is replacing the legacy tender-based program under the DPS. Service members expressed concerns regarding the previous relocation program. To address these concerns, the chosen solution involves utilizing a single move manager. The GHC is a federal contract, and the requirements of a federal contract implementing a moving program are significantly different than requirements associated with the legacy program using DPS. The contract has been deployed since 1 April 2024, from local moves at selected sites to almost all installations in CONUS being activated under the GHC. To provide additional information on the GHC, please access the following link to better understand the contract, why it was created and the intended benefits of its use: https(slash)(slash)www.militaryonesource.mil/resources/ millife-guides/ustranscom-global-household-goods-contract/. 1.c. U.S. Transportation Command's J9 Defense Personal Property Program Management Office (USTC J9 DPMO) manages the Personal Property Program for the DoD and USTC Acquisition (TCAQ) manages the Contract. GHC uses the MilMove system to create a move request, verify requirements with service members and civilian employees, and perform government required operations to order shipment services from the Contractor, HomeSafe. HomeSafe uses their system, HomeSafeConnect, to coordinate with individual service members and civilian employees to move shipments. The GHC continues to be rolled out over the next several months and some moves will remain in the legacy system DPS. Please note that all Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) moves will continue to use the legacy DPS until after Peak Moving Season 2025 (around the end of August/early September) and then will begin phasing CONUS to OCONUS, OCONUS to OCONUS and OCONUS to CONUS shipments to the GHC. The responses provided in the questionnaire/shipment sort tool located on the DPS Landing Page as detailed in paragraph three (3) will determine which move system a Marine will use. 1.d. GHC does not currently support Non-temporary Storage (NTS) shipments, POV Shipments and Mobile Home shipments. These requirements will be performed using DPS and the PCSMYPOV.com website until further notice by USTC J9 DPMO. The DPS Landing Page sort tool in paragraph 3 will be updated to reflect these additional capabilities in the future. Ref (a) provides two sets of regulations supporting legacy DPS and GHC contract processes and procedures and are identified as Part IV-A DPS/ETOPS and Part IV-B MilMove (GHC). 2. Issues with Marine's CONUS PCS HHG Move DPS/GHC 2.a. As with any PCS move there may be issues with shipment support. Regardless of which HHG move system (legacy DPS or GHC MilMove) is used, when issues arise such as missed pack start dates, missed pickup dates, missed delivery dates, or other issues including communication with the moving company or representative assigned to the Marine's move, use the following procedures to reach out for assistance: 2.a.(1). Contact the Point of Contact (POC) at the moving company/ local agent/customer support representative assigned to the move and request an update on the specific issue. For GHC moves, contact (904) 567-6033. 2.a.(2). Should the respective POC not resolve the concerns, and the Marine is located on a Marine Corps installation, immediately notify the Distribution Management Office, Personal Property Office, Quality Assurance Section. When not located on a Marine Corps installation, immediately notify the nearest Transportation Office, ask for the Personal Property Office, and ask for the Quality Assurance Section to report the issue. The phone numbers of the Quality Assurance Section at origin and destination are provided during counseling. When not located at a DoD installation such as on recruiting duty, Inspector-Instructor duty or other assignment, contact the Quality Assurance phone number provided during counseling or the official USMC Personal Property mailbox at usmcpersonalproperty@usmc.mil and provide the DPS Bill of Lading Number or MilMove Move Number, state the exact move issue, POC information of the company representative, Marine's POC information including phone number and any additional info related to the move, and a Personal Property Team Member will contact the Marine as quickly as possible. 2.a.(3). Marines should document all communication with TSPs or the Contractor (HomeSafe) to ensure they can refer to notes and email should there be an issue with the move. 3. Initial Steps to Plan and Execute the PCS Move DPS/GHC 3.a. Personal Property Shipment and Storage Requirements. Once notification is received that PCS orders are forthcoming or already in hand, Marines MUST use the following options to access the DPS Landing Page to coordinate their move as ALL SHIPMENTS must be coordinated using the DPS Landing Page. Even if the Marine already has a DPS account, the Marine MUST use the instructions below to get to the DPS Landing Page and follow the instructions from there. 3.b. Option one: Navigate to the DPS Landing page by following this link: https:(slash)(slash)dps.move.mil/cust/standard/user/home.xhtml. Once on the DPS Landing Page, the Marine will accept the Security banner instructions, then scroll down to DPS LOGIN OPTIONS and see the \"CUSTOMER (I need to ship personal property)\" tool called the \"Sort Tool\". The Sort Tool is designed to sort applications between DPS and GHC. Once at the \"Sort Tool\" Marines must follow the instructions as a \"CUSTOMER (I need to ship personal property).\" Accurate responses to the questions will ensure Marines are routed to the correct system. Marines must enter correct email addresses to facilitate communications throughout the application and onboarding process. Use ONLY commercial/personal email addresses on the application(s) for communication, especially for those Marines separating or retiring. DO NOT use your @usmc.mil address. 3.c. Option 2: While the DPS link above is the best method to access the DPS Landing Page, Marines may also use the Military One Source website at www.militaryonesource.mil/moving-pcs/ moving-personal-property and click on LOGIN TO DPS to reach the DPS Landing Page. 3.d. For those that choose the Military One Source website, scroll down the page and explore the various links and tabs to learn how the generic move process works. Locate the supporting Personal Property Processing Office (PPPO)/Installation Transportation Office (ITO), determine the weight of household goods, receive initial personal property entitlement and allowance information, review POV shipment and storage instructions, review instructions on claim filing, and much more. 3.e. If technical issues arise with the DPS Landing Page, contact the System Response Center for assistance at 800.462.2176 or email at usarmy.scott.sddc.mbx.g6-src-dps-hd@army.mil. 4. Counseling requirements and system selections/considerations applies to DPS/GHC. 4.a. Marines conducting their first move, Marines separating or retiring, and Marines moving a mobile home must receive additional counseling because of varying entitlements. Visit/contact your local PPPO before submitting the shipment application to learn about your shipping requirements and entitlements. 4.b. Marines will perform self-counseling using the DPS Landing Page instructions provided in paragraph 3 for DPS shipments or will be provided separate counseling instructions by the Personal Property Office for GHC MilMove supporting the installation/the nearest installation. 4.b.(1). Marines using DPS to manage their shipment are encouraged to take notes on entitlements, allowances, and procedures during counseling. Once complete with reviewing the counseling information, upload the required documents such as PCS Orders and endorsements, and note any questions not covered by DPS Counseling. The next step is to contact or visit the nearest installation PPPO to receive targeted counseling on questions noted during DPS counseling and submit any additional documents, including documents for a Personally Procured Move (PPM) and/or to complete shipment or storage for a POV. 4.b.(2). Marines directed to use MilMove must follow the instructions to create an account and follow through with the process requirements. Personnel without a CAC, such as separatees or retirees, contact the nearest Personal Property Office or usmcpersonalproperty@usmc.mil for instructions. Personal Property Office counselors will ensure each Marine is properly counseled. 4.c. Planning the Move Dates. Marines MUST complete their counseling and submit their requested pickup date as soon as possible after receipt of their orders, but not less than 90 days before their requested pickup date when possible. 4.d. Important dates to consider. The most popular peak season pickup dates (the peak of the peak season) are immediately following the Memorial Day weekend through mid-July. HHG moves in this 45-day window are difficult to schedule because of the high demand for shipments across the Department of Defense. Therefore, the sooner an application is submitted, the sooner the requested pickup date can be considered. Also, be aware that the first two days and last two days of every month may be difficult to schedule as pickup dates because of the timing of rental and lease agreements. 4.e. Requested pickup dates are not confirmed until the Transportation Service Provider (TSP) or HomeSafe representative contacts the Marine in writing via email with the confirmed pickup date(s). This sets the 7 Day Spread for Routine Shipments (described in paragraph 4.g.). Should unexpected circumstances require a change to the pickup and or delivery dates, Marines should be aware that new pickup and/or delivery dates that meet their needs may not be available. Marines MUST contact their supporting Personal Property Office/PPSO Outbound Shipment Section/Shipment Management Section immediately to attempt to schedule new pickup and/or delivery dates. 4.f. Marines may have multiple shipments, and a different company may be assigned to each shipment, particularly for orders OCONUS. Please note, be careful to not overlap multiple shipment pickup and delivery dates because (although unlikely) it could cause the wrong items to be packed and placed in the wrong shipment. If this occurs, a \"break-in\" cost will be charged to the Marine seeking to retrieve items. To avoid those costs, schedule requested pickup and delivery dates accordingly and when possible, be sure to physically separate different shipments for different locations. 4.g. The 7 Day Spread for Routine Shipments DPS/GHC. 4.g.(1). The 7 Day Spread for DPS/GHC shipments: Marines will provide a requested pickup date, which should be the last day the HHGs are ready for pickup. The preceding six (6) calendar days before the requested pickup date will be set as the 7 Day Spread period. The Marine will submit a preferred pickup date that must fall within the 7 Day Spread. When the shipment is awarded to a TSP/GHC Contractor, the TSP/GHC Contractor may select the requested pickup date, or the TSP/GHC Contractor may select any one of the other previous six (6) calendar days before the requested pickup date to pick up the shipment. The TSP/GHC Contractor must provide the confirmed pickup date in writing via email to the Marine within three (3) calendar days from the date the shipment was awarded. The Marine and TSP/GHC Contractor may negotiate the pickup date; however, the TSP must accommodate a pickup date within the spread-date window. Once established, the pickup date cannot change without the Marine's approval and notification by the Marine and the TSP/GHC Contractor of the approved date change to the Personal Property Shipping Office (PPSO). Weekends and holidays may be part of the previous six (6) calendar days but are not normally used for routine shipment pickup dates unless the Marine wants to be picked up on a weekend/holiday and the TSP/GHC Contractor can accommodate this request. Weekend/holiday pickup dates must be approved by the Marine, the TSP/GHC Contractor, and the PPSO that awarded the shipment to the TSP/GHC Contractor. Note that there may not be Government Quality Assurance personnel available on weekends or holidays. For Marines seeking to move on a weekend or holiday, confirm Government Quality Assurance personnel support with their local Personal Property Office before the pickup date. If the Marine cannot support the pickup date selected by the TSP/GHC Contractor, the Marine must immediately contact the shipping office to explain why that date is not supportable and request a different date. For additional details on the 7 Day Spread for Routine Shipments, Marines are encouraged to contact their local Personal Property Office. 4.g.(2). Note 1. For planning purposes use 4,000 pounds of HHG weight as equal to one day of packing for DPS shipments. Therefore, 16,500 pounds of HHG weight equals up to five days of packing immediately before the confirmed pickup date, unless those days are weekends or a holiday, in which case the packing on those dates must be agreed to by the Marine, the TSP, and the PPSO that awarded the shipment to the TSP. The confirmed pickup date should drive all other dates needed to clear quarters and other requirements necessary to execute the move. In GHC, the packing days will be determined during the premove survey. Once established, the pickup date should not be changed unless it is necessary to make a change due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the Marine because new pickup dates may not be available due to the high volume of moves. To estimate the weight for each shipment, use the authorized weight estimator located at this link: https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dp3/weightestimator.cfm. Short Fuse shipments are not eligible for the 7 Day Spread and will be processed per paragraph 4.h. 4.g.(3). Note 2. For DPS moves, information on the selected TSP is available at this website: https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil /dp3/tspinformation.cfm#tspdetail. The Marine will provide the four-digit Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC), which is assigned to every TSP, to enable the search feature. The SCAC will be identified on the email from the PPSO that announces which TSP was awarded the shipment. Select Sort by: \"SCAC\" and enter the TSP's SCAC to search for TSP ratings. Almost every TSP will have at least one Letter of Warning and/or Letter of Suspension which will be identified on the TSP Metrics page. When the Marine has questions regarding the selected TSP, contact the PPSO at the phone number/email address provided on the shipment award email to discuss. 4.g.(4). Note 3. Nontemporary Storage (NTS) shipment pickup date from the NTS facility is not affected by a 7 day spread. 4.h. Short Fuse shipments DPS/GHC. A Short Fuse shipment is a short notice PCS requirement when the Marine receives PCS Orders with limited time between the orders issuance date and the Estimated Departure Date, such as \"10-day orders,\" and orders issued for various schools based on promotion dates, etc., that are beyond the Marine's control. In the rare cases when these short notice situations arise, it is understandable that coordinating all the elements for a PCS move can be overwhelming. Commanders at all leadership levels are encouraged to allow the Marine the necessary time to complete preparations for the move. There are several checklist tools available for a Marine requiring immediate support. Further, all Marines should plan the move as soon as possible and complete the counseling process accordingly. In the event circumstances beyond the control of the Marine (TAD, Formal Schools, etc., and supported by documentation) prevent an early submission of the shipment application, or applications when OCONUS PCS Orders are issued, contact the local PPPO and inform them of the issues associated with the delay in submitting the required application(s). Confirmed pickup date(s) should drive all other dates needed to clear quarters and other requirements necessary to execute the move. Marines should not wait until the last minute to submit their shipment applications as shipping capacity may not be available or within DPS, lesser quality moving companies may be the only moving companies available for the shipment. When capacity is constrained, it is very important to manage the move and ensure details are clearly explained and supported by all involved. 4.j. Lithium Battery shipment and storage limitations DPS/GHC. Since 15 May 2023, the moving company has been required to properly package, label, and certify lithium-ion cells rated at 100 watt-hours or less (20 watt-hours or less for a single cell) and lithium metal batteries containing two (2) grams or less of lithium content (one (1) gram or less for single cells). Questions regarding lithium batteries can be directed to the local PPO and should be discussed in counseling sessions to ensure there are no violations of this requirement. 4.k. Professional Books, Papers, and Equipment (PBP&E), aka \"Pro Gear\" DPS/GHC. The maximum weight limit for Pro Gear for Marines of all ranks is 2,000 pounds. Marines may request an additional weight allowance up to 500 pounds for spouse Pro Gear required for employment or community support activities for their spouse (civilian employee spouses are not authorized a PBP&E weight allowance). All Pro Gear requests must be submitted to the local PPPO for consideration before the move. Ensure inventory items that are Pro Gear are weighed separately (bathroom scales are acceptable) to obtain a weight on each item. Also, items designated as Pro Gear on the inventory must be marked as M-PRO for the Service member or S-PRO for the spouse of the Service member. See the Defense Transportation Regulation Part IV-A, Appendix K1 \"It's Your Move\" https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_part_iv_att_A -k_1.pdf for a list of items that qualify as Pro Gear. For civilian employees, see Appendix K2 \"It's Your Move\" https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_part_iv_att_A -k_2.pdf. 4.l. Additional Counseling and Contact Information DPS/GHC. The official Marine Corps Facebook Page for Personal Property is located at www.facebook.com/usmchouseholdgoods. The official Marine Corps Facebook Page for Passenger Travel is located at www.facebook.com/ usmcpassengertravel. LPD Public Page for PCS Move Resources related to Personal Property Shipment and Storage, Passenger Travel and other critical information is located at: https:(slash)(slash)www. iandl.marines.mil/Divisions/Logistics-Division-LP/Logistics- Distribution-Policy-Branch-LPD/PCS-Move-Resources/. 4.m. Sailors assigned to Marine Corps units should also access the Navy Household Goods and Personal Property website at https:(slash)(slash)www.navsup.navy.mil/NAVSUP-Household-Goods/Home/ for Navy-specific entitlements, allowances and procedures. 4.n. Post Counseling and Follow-Up Actions Before the Move DPS/GHC. A Personal Property Shipping Office representative may contact the Marine to confirm a certain element or elements of a shipment prior to awarding the shipment to a TSP/GHC Contractor. Once the shipment is awarded, a pre-move survey will also be performed by the TSP/GHC Contractor. Further, the TSP/GHC Contractor may request the use of an electronic pre-move survey, using a cell phone with camera, to conduct the survey. This method is authorized when approved by the Marine. 4.o. Personally Procured Move (PPM) DPS/GHC. BE IN CONTROL OF THE MOVE. PPMs are available in DPS and GHC MilMove and the Sort Tool will provide which system is the correct method for the move. PPMs are designed for the Marine to be their own moving company. Most Marines will request a PPM to have more freedom when making decisions regarding when the shipment will be picked up, how soon it will be transported to the destination and the delivery timeline. Using ANY moving company or services will tie the Marine to a contract that may limit their options. There are several benefits to executing a PPM, especially during peak season: (1) Marines can choose who (the Marine, a moving company, friends, family or combination), when, and how to move their HHG, (2) potentially no delays in receiving the HHG at destination, (3) Marines are in charge of caring for their own HHG, and (4) potentially more money in the Marine's pocket based on how much work they do (sweat equity) to keep their costs low. Note: PPM incentives are taxed for both Federal and State (when applicable). Additionally, operating expenses are not reimbursed dollar for dollar but are used to offset the tax liability associated with the incentive. 4.o.1. Marines can receive 100% of the Government's cost to move the same weight (up to the maximum authorized weight allowance based on rank and with or without dependents) from the authorized origin location to the authorized destination location in the PCS Orders. Marines are authorized storage up to (90) days at a commercial storage facility not to exceed the Government's cost to store the same weight. 4.o.2. Marines executing a PPM to Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. territories and possessions must be counseled and documents properly prepared in DPS (in use for these moves only at this time) to ensure they are advised of information particular to the destination, such as the requirement to verify the use of U.S. Flag vessels when the shipment is transiting over ocean. 4.o.3. Marines performing a routine PCS must use their Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) for all expenses related to a PPM. As of the date of publication of this MARADMIN DoD Civilians are not restricted from using their GTCC for PCS moves. Marines must also notify their Agency Program Coordinator (APC) to adjust the credit limits and PCS Mission Critical status to accommodate the required use of the GTCC at least 10 days prior to departure to ensure the Marine has a maximum amount of time to submit and settle their PPM Claim. The GTCC cannot be used for separation travel, to include PPMs in conjunction with separation travel of separatees and retirees. For those Marines who do not possess a GTCC, an Advance Operating Allowance (AOA) \"may\" be authorized as an exception to policy, however Marines who are using only their POV(s) to execute a PPM are not eligible to receive an AOA. 4.o.4. Marines must also provide empty and full weight tickets and submit their completed PPM Claim via Marine Online (MOL) and/or Milmove for GHC moves. If MOL is not available, Marines may turn the completed claim in to the Marine Corps installation Personal Property Office at destination. Make a complete copy of the PPM Claim before it is turned over for settlement regardless of which method is used. Marines who receive an AOA must submit their PPM claim for settlement within 45 days of receipt of the AOA. Review the PPM Claim settlement website at: https:(slash)(slash)www.logcom. marines.mil/Marines/Personally-Procured-Move/ for the latest information on how to prepare and submit a PPM Claim in DPS or in GHC MilMove and the estimated processing time and payment dates for settled PPM Claims. Additional information on PPM processes and claims settlement can be accessed using the link provided in paragraph 4.l. 5. Executing the Move DPS/GHC. Pre-move preparations are fully explained at this website https:(slash)(slash)www.militaryonesource.mil/moving-housing/moving/ moving-resources/. The residence or other pickup location must be ready for the packers to begin their work. At origin, Marines may need to contact the origin PPPO Quality Assurance Section, the TSP or the TSP;s local agent responsible for packing and picking up the shipment, to resolve any issues with the TSP crewmembers, loaders or drivers. Under GHC, the Marine should have received a notification that the photos of each team member are loaded to the HomeSafe Connect application on their phone the day prior to the move. At destination, Marines may need to contact the destination PPPO Quality Assurance Section to resolve any issues with the TSP or the GHC Contractor crew. Origin PCS Counselors will annotate the contact phone numbers of both the Origin and Destination Quality Assurance Sections in the Remarks Block of the DD FORM 1299, Application for Shipment and/or Storage of Personal Property for DPS moves and with in MilMove for GHC moves. In the event the DD FORM 1299 is misplaced, Marines may use https:(slash)(slash)installations.militaryonesource.mil/search?progr am-service=2/view-by=ALL to locate Quality Assurance Section phone numbers. 5.a. Quality Assurance Inspections for all Shipments DPS/GHC. Personal Property Quality Assurance Inspectors are authorized to inspect all shipments at origin and destination, including PPM shipments, before and during packing/loading and unloading/ unpacking. Also, weight scale operators on military installations can inspect shipments at the scales to ensure only authorized household goods are being weighed in accordance with ref (b), Chapter 4. 5.b. During and After the Move (Completing the Customer Satisfaction Survey in stages) DPS/GHC. Marines should complete the Customer Satisfaction Survey within seven (7) calendar days after notification that an element of the move is completed, such as Counseling, Origin Services, Destination Services and Claims. The comments and scores given to each response for the services provided contributes toward eliminating poor performers from the legacy DPS Defense Personal Property Program and ensures the best moving companies get the most shipments. This survey also tells the Government how effectively the GHC contractor, HomeSafe, performed. Regardless of which move system is used, Marines MUST make their voices heard by completing the Customer Satisfaction Survey as their move progresses to delivery and, when necessary, after claims completion. 6. Personal Property Claims DPS/GHC 6.a. Lost and Damage Claims. For DPS and GHC shipment claims, please visit the guide located at https:(slash)(slash)www.militaryonesource.mil/moving- housing/moving /planning-your-move/file-a-claim-after-your-military-move/. For non-DPS claims, such as contracted moves called Direct Procurement Method moves, or if Marines still have questions on their DPS claims, Marines should contact the Navy Personnel Claims Unit at (888) 897-8217, (757) 440-6315 (DSN 564) or email NorfolkClaims@us.navy.mil. Marines have 180 days from the delivery of each shipment to identify additional lost or damaged items using the after delivery form. Marines must also file their claim within 9 months from the delivery date. Marines are encouraged to complete their check of all delivered items as soon as possible after delivery to ensure every item that is lost or damaged is clearly identified to the delivery TSP within 180 days. The 180 days after delivery reporting time does not apply to shipments delivered using the Direct Procurement Method (DPM) and local moves in the DPS process. Such moves have 75 days from delivery date to identify loss or damage. Note that the TSP maximum liability for each HHG shipment is 75,000 dollars, but Military Claims Offices can compensate the difference between the TSP maximum and the depreciated value for the remainder of the shipment items not covered by the TSP maximum. Marines who own high dollar items and/or the overall cost to replace the entire HHGs exceeds the TSP maximum may consider private insurance or verify with their homeowner/rental property policy to determine coverage for HHGs when performing a move. A complete and accurate visual inventory of the Marine's personal property (photographic evidence) is key to submission and settlement of any lost and/or damage claim, whether filed with the TSP/GHC HomeSafe or the Military Claims office. 6.b. Inconvenience Claims DPS/GHC. When HHGs are not picked up or delivered on the agreed upon dates, Marines may qualify to file an Inconvenience Claim with the DPS TSP or the GHC Contractor. Shipments moved under the Direct Procurement Method (DPM) do not qualify for Inconvenience Claims as this time. Unaccompanied Baggage delays may not be payable under DPS when the government is responsible for the delay. However, under the GHC contract, HomeSafe is responsible for inconvenience claims for ALL shipment types except PPMs when OCONUS shipment capabilities are deployed. Download the latest Inconvenience Claim Information Handout from the USMC (slash) USTC Handouts and Brochures link identified in paragraph 11.a. of this MARADMIN. 6.c. Real Property (Residence) Damage Claims DPS/GHC. When a TSP/GHC Contractor damages the residence in any way, Marines may be able to submit a Real Property Damage Claim to the TSP/GHC HomeSafe. There is a seven (7) calendar day limit to notify the TSP of the damage to the residence and the TSP must determine repair estimate within 15 days of notification of the damage. To meet deadlines and PCS on time, Marines must be proactive with photographs and notifications to the TSP/GHC HomeSafe regarding these damages. 7. OCONUS Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) Shipment and Storage 7.a. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2025 authorizes two POVs for shipment/storage for uniformed Service members. However, until the entitlement is published in the Joint Travel Regulations, ref (c), by the Per Diem, Travel, and Transportation Allowance Committee, only one POV is authorized shipment at government expense and only under certain conditions. This MARADMIN refers to the current entitlements in effect on the date of publication. Marines conducting a PCS move to, from or between OCONUS locations may be entitled to ship or store one POV at government expense. Contact the local PPPO for information regarding POV entitlements based on the OCONUS destination and prepare required documents needed to ship or store the POV. Generally, a POV that cannot be shipped OCONUS because of a country restriction is authorized storage and may be stored in government contracted facilities or stored by the Marine in self-procured POV storage. Regardless of the method, storage must be approved in advance by the PPPO. The reimbursable monthly storage rate for self-procured POV storage is based on the monthly POV storage rate paid by the Government to the Global POV Contractor (GPC) International Auto Logistics (IAL). Prior to the issuance of this current contract on 1 October 2024, rates changed annually. The monthly storage rate for reimbursement is stable throughout the life of the current contract so contact your local Personal Property Office for the current monthly storage rate in effect from 1 October 2024 until a new contract is issued, or a renegotiated change is in effect. 7.b. Marines must use www.pcsmypov.com to make an appointment for POV drop-off or pick-up at government provided storage facilities. During peak season, demand is high for appointments so make them as soon as possible once orders are received. Marines remaining OCONUS with new orders must provide them to the GPC to ensure continuation of storage at Government expense. 7.c. Marines must prove to the PPPO Counselor and the Vehicle Processing Center (VPC) that all safety recall repairs have been performed on the POV prior to turning in the POV for shipment or storage. Self-procured POV storage businesses may not require the safety recall repairs to be completed prior to placement in storage, but Marines should complete them upon notification by the manufacturer per the instructions in the notification document. 7.d. Late Arrival at Destination. Ref (c), par. 0534 provides the current reimbursement rate. As of 1 February 2025, when a POV is delayed at destination, the Marine rates reimbursement for the cost of a rental vehicle for the Marine or their dependent's use at $30 per day (one POV only) for a maximum of $210. 7.e. For information on how to prepare a POV for shipment or storage, review the documents Shipping Your POV, Appendix K3 and Storing Your POV, Appendix K4 of the Defense Transportation Regulation, Part IV, Personal Property, System A at https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_part_iv_app_k _3.pdf and https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_ part_iv_app_k_4.pdf. 7.f. Note that POVs will not be picked up for shipment from a commercial storage facility or any other location that is not under the control of the Global POV Contractor without the POV's owner or a person authorized by the owner with Power of Attorney (POA) onsite for the pickup. A copy of the POA, when used, must be provided as part of the shipment request. The Marine/person with a POA MUST BE PRESENT when the contractor arrives. The Marine will be charged for a missed pickup fee due to the Marine's failure or the person with a POA's failure to execute the pickup on the provided date and time. There are NO exceptions to this requirement. 8. Overseas Moves (OCONUS) Travel Preparations/Overseas Screening and HHG Shipments. Overseas Suitability Screening (OSS) and OCONUS counseling. The overseas screening process may take up to 60 days or more; therefore, Marines shall commence overseas screening immediately upon receipt of orders. In order to ensure the Marine reports to the overseas station by the required date, the importance of complete and timely screening cannot be over-emphasized. Each Marine MUST immediately initiate OSS through a Military Medical Treatment Facility for all dependents authorized to accompany the Marine to ensure suitability for OCONUS assignments. In the meantime, Marines should continue to plan to execute their HHG shipment pickup dates while this process is occurring. In the event the orders are modified or canceled, Marines MUST notify the PPSO immediately for further instructions. Additional OCONUS counseling information is also available at https:(slash)(slash)www.militaryonesource.mil/moving-housing/moving/ moving-resources/ and the links in paragraph 4.l. of this MARADMIN. 9. Travel Compliance/Marines Traveling Accompanied with Dependents 9.a. Travel Compliance. Each traveler is responsible to ensure they comply with all travel requirements prior to the departure date from the airport for a commercial flight or from the Aerial Port of Embarkation for Air Mobility Command - Patriot Express (AMC-PE) flights. Marines should maintain all receipts during travel as many expenses are reimbursable. Marines should contact their supporting Installation Personnel Administration Center or Disbursing Office for more information regarding travel allowances and reimbursement processes. Civilian Marines should contact their supporting Human Resources Office for such information. 9.b. U.S. Marine Corps PCS Advocacy Council (UPAC, volunteer spouses of Marines) and DC, I&L (LPD) and MCICOM G4 DMO prepared very detailed checklists for Marines executing a PCS to Japan, Hawaii, and within CONUS that covers everything from travel and passports to scheduling moves and settling claims, plus many additional steps needed to execute a PCS with and without dependents. The checklists can be downloaded by visiting the LPD Public Page for PCS Move Resources website. Information on UPAC support is also provided on the website: https:(slash)(slash)www.iandl.marines.mil/Divisions/Logistics- Division-LP/Logistics-Distribution-Policy-Branch-LPD/PCS-Move- Resources/. 9.c. Marines should coordinate with the receiving command-designated sponsor and the Housing Office to determine availability of on-base housing. To obtain the latest status of available housing on Okinawa, Japan contact Housing at DSN 315-634-0582 or kadenahousing.customerservice@us.af.mil. 9.d. Special Issuance Passports (SIP) and Visas. SIPs and Visas may be required for Marines, civilians, and their dependents whenever they travel to OCONUS locations. Ref (d) provides the requirements necessary for entry into a particular country and can be accessed for personnel with a Common Access Card (CAC) at link: https:(slash)(slash)www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg.cfm. *NOTE: Official Orders should also state passport requirements. When SIPs/visas are required, applications must be prepared and submitted to a DoD Passport Agent as soon as possible due to an 8-11-week application processing period. DoD Passport Agents may be located within the DMO Passenger Travel Office or other locations aboard the installation. 10. Baggage on Commercial and Government Contracted Carrier. Marines executing PCS travel on a commercial or government contracted carrier, via aircraft, ship, train, or bus, are authorized reimbursement for no more than two (2) bags, 70 pounds or less each, not to exceed 62 linear inches (sum of length plus width plus height) plus a small carry-on per reserved seat. Excess baggage is defined as all baggage more than this quantity, weight, and/or size. Excess baggage will not be authorized prior to a Marine's departure. A Marine is subject to the commercial carrier's established baggage restrictions and fee schedules and is required to pay the commercial carrier in accordance with the carrier's fee schedule. A Marine may submit for reimbursement via their PCS travel claim for baggage fee expenses when their baggage does not exceed two checked bags, not to exceed 70 pounds, per authorized traveler. Requests for reimbursement of excess baggage may be submitted to MMIB-3 after PCS travel has been completed if the contents of the baggage was necessary at the future permanent duty station (PDS) prior to the arrival of the UB shipment and the items were not available at the future PDS. For further information, contact the local Passenger Travel Office (PTO) or see the AMC-PE Travel Page at link: https:(slash)(slash)www.amc.af.mil/AMC-Travel-Site/. 11. Transporting Pets 11.a. The key to a successful pet move is early planning and constant follow- through. Marines who are being reassigned to, from or between OCONUS locations are encouraged to immediately visit their local PTO located within the DMO to establish transportation requirements for their pets. Be aware it may take up to six months to complete all the requirements for ensuring pet(s) can be imported to an OCONUS location. 11.b. PCS orders are NOT required to submit reservations for PCS travelers and pets (dogs and cats only) on AMC-PE nor do pets have to be cited within the orders for reimbursement purposes. Because pet reservations will be apportioned on a first come/first served basis, pet transportation needs should be identified to the local PTO as soon as the Marine has a general idea of the required departure month. Reservations will be finalized when AMC schedules the flight on/about 90 days prior to the flight departure date. At that time, pet space requests will be submitted by the PTO. However, because of limited space on the AMC-PE and the flight is available to members of all Services, there is no guarantee of a pet reservation no matter how early a Marine registers a pet movement requirement. Once the Marine completes the PCS Outbound Interview located in Marine Online (MOL), follow up with the PTO is required to finalize all pet travel arrangements. 11.b.(1). A Service member on a PCS order with an effective date of January 1, 2024, or later, as defined in ref (c), paragraph 050107, may be authorized reimbursement for the costs related to the relocation of one household pet that arises from a permanent change of station. A household pet is a cat or a dog, owned for personal companionship. A Service member is responsible for compliance with all rules for importing and exporting a pet to and from the United States to be eligible for reimbursement. Denial of entry for the pet could result in denial of reimbursement for pet transport expenses. Reimbursement for the actual cost of authorized pet related transportation expenses is limited to $550 per CONUS PCS move and $2,000 per OCONUS PCS move. A Service member may be authorized the reasonable and substantiated cost of mandatory microchipping, quarantine fees, boarding fees, hotel service charges, licensing fees at the new PDS, testing titer levels for entry, and pet shipping fees if the member flies rather than drives, or the pet is shipped separately from the member. For transoceanic travel, use of Government or Government procured transportation must be used if available or reimbursement for transportation costs is not authorized. In extenuating circumstances where both Patriot Express capacity and regularly scheduled commercial airline service are not available for pets, the Secretarial Process may approve pet transportation expenses that exceed $2,000 for an OCONUS PCS, not to exceed $4,000, for a Service member that departs a permanent duty station listed in JTR supplement AP-PQ-02 at link: www.travel.dod.mil/Portals/119/Documents/JTR/Supplements/pet_ allowance_locations.pdf. This authority became effective November 25, 2024. Requests for Secretarial Process for this supplement may be submitted via AA Form with supporting documentation and command endorsement to CMC (M&RA, MPO-40) via SMB_HQMC_MPO@USMC.MIL for consideration. 11.b.(2). Transportation of a Pet to or from an Alternate Location or a Designated Place Effective 1 April 2025 11.b.(2).(a). Alternate Location. Transportation of a pet to an alternate location may be authorized if a member with or without dependents owns a pet and receives PCS orders to a PDS where Government quarters rules prohibit the possession of a pet, a particular breed that the Service member owns is prohibited from being transported to the new PDS, or airline policy prohibits the transportation of the pet due to breed or other factors. Transportation of the pet from the alternate location may be authorized upon the member's receipt of new PCS orders. Transportation of a pet to an alternate location may be authorized in the case of a member's death. 11.b.(2).(b) Designated Place. Transportation of a pet may be authorized to accompany dependents to a designated place when a Service member receives PCS orders to serve an unaccompanied or dependent restricted tour, or to an assignment specified as unusually arduous sea duty, or in the case of an early return of dependents at Government expense. Transportation of the pet from the designated place may be authorized upon the member's receipt of new PCS orders. 11.b.(3). The government contracted AMC-PE rotator flights offer a discounted rate (ranging from 125 dollars to 375 dollars depending on pet weight) to transport pets. However, the number of pet spaces per flight is very limited. The maximum weight allowed for a combined pet and kennel is 150 pounds, which cannot be waived. Marines are responsible for obtaining an authorized kennel/carrier bolted with metal nuts/bolts that provides adequate ventilation and ample space for safe pet movement. Soft-sided pet kennels/carriers may be accepted for in-cabin movement only. See the AMC Pet Travel Information Page at https:(slash)(slash) www.amc.af.mil/AMC-Travel-Site/AMC-Pet-Travel- Page/ then click on AMC Pet Pamphlet 20 October 2023 or later date when updated on the website. 11.c. Emotional Support Animals and Service Animals. The U.S. Department of Transportation revised its Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) regulation on the transportation of Service Animals by air. This final rule defines a Service Animal as a dog, regardless of breed or type, that is individually trained for the benefit of a qualified individual. It allows airlines to recognize Emotional Support Animals as pets, rather than Service Animals, and permits airlines to limit the number of Service Animals that one passenger can bring onboard an aircraft to two Service Animals. Please find more information concerning this matter at: https:(slash)(slash)www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us- department-transportation-announces-final-rule-traveling-air- service-animals. Review the procedures for Service Animals currently posted on the AMC Travel Page or contact the local PTO for the current policy related to Service Animals and AMC-PE transportation. 11.d. Other Options for Moving Pets. Marines should research all methods as early as possible to select the overall best transportation methods for their pets, including quarantine requirements and costs (Germany, Hawaii, Japan, Korea and Guam). Options include services offered by regularly scheduled commercial airlines, including both US and Foreign Flag-carriers (NOTE: Marines cannot legally be reimbursed if using a Foreign Flag carrier for transport of your pet), and dedicated pet relocation services. Regardless of the method, all pets traveling to or returning from OCONUS require a health certificate from a certified veterinarian. The animal health screening process may include several visits to the veterinarian, a quarantine period, and shots which may take at least six months prior to the expected travel date to complete. The following website provides helpful information and guidelines to consider when traveling with a pet followed by direct links to each of the City Pair Program's participating airline carrier's pet and service animal policy: https:(slash)(slash)www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/transportation- airfare-pov-etc/airfare-rates-city-pairs-programs/resource-library/ airline-pet-policy. 11.e. Non-Availability. If Government transportation is directed, but not available, the traveler must provide a statement from the Traffic Management Office (TMO) or Installation Transportation Office (ITO) that Government transportation is not available. When traveling by POV, such as to or from Alaska, a non-availability statement is not required. 11.f. For further pet transportation assistance, contact the local PTO, located in the DMO at Marine Corps installations, and within Installation Transportation Offices DoD-wide, or visit the official Marine Corps Passenger Travel Facebook page at www.facebook.com/usmcpassengertravel and the LPD-2 Public Page at: https:(slash)(slash)www.iandl.marines.mil/Divisions/Logistics- Division-LP/Logistics-Distribution-Policy-Branch-LPD/PCS-Move- Resources/. 12. Critical Links 12.a. All move reference documents, Helpful Links, checklists and other tutorials supporting PCS Moves, UPAC CONUS and OCONUS Facebook Page links, and Personally Procured Move briefs/links are located on the LPD Public Page for PCS Move Resources at: https:(slash)(slash)www.iandl.marines.mil/Divisions/Logistics- Division-LP/Logistics-Distribution-Policy-Branch-LPD/PCS-Move- Resources/. 12.b. Marine Corps Community Services (MCCS) Information, Referral and Relocation Services connects individuals to military, Department of Defense, and community resources, including health care, personal and family counseling, marital counseling, relocation assistance, housing referral, childcare resources, religious services, recreation services, consumer affairs, child and spouse abuse prevention programs, and other personal and family support programs in both the military and civilian community. MCCS Information, Referral and Relocation Services also coordinate classes for CONUS and OCONUS PCS moves. Visit their Home Page for installation specific information at: https:(slash)(slash)www.usmc-mccs.org/marine-family-support/ information-referral-and-relocation. 13. Keys to Success. Early counseling, planning, preparation, flexibility, communication, and command support are the keys to executing a successful PCS move and especially during this challenging peak season. Contact the origin and/or destination Personal Property Office (PPO)/Passenger Travel Office (PTO) for additional information, training, and support. 14. Release authorized by MajGen Jason G. Woodworth, Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics (LF)/Commander, Marine Corps Installations Command.//"

As zones and allocations are subject to change prior to or during the board all Marines are reminded of their responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of their records prior to the convene date of the board. 9.c. Details related to lateral moves (LATMOVE) are listed on the Enlisted Promotions website. Marines who received an adjusted date of rank or make a LATMOVE after this MARADMIN is released must notify MMPB-11 in writing by 2359, EST on 27 June 2025. 9.d.

This MARADMIN highlights command responsibilities for the completion of command chronologies and announces History Division (HD) support available to assist with those responsibilities. 2. Background. 2.a. Command chronologies are the single most important body of historical records created, collected, and maintained by the Marine Corps. Command chronologies are submitted by active and reserve Marine Corps units to provide a concise review of each unit's operational experiences and significant events, and include supporting documents detailing the activities of the unit on a continuing basis. Unit command chronologies are frequently requested in support of award submissions, as part of legal investigations, and to tell the Marine Corps story to Congress and the American public. They are used to support official research for HQMC, Marine units, and Marine veterans pursuing Department of Veterans Affairs claims. The information they contain informs force design decisions and is the basis for unit lineage and honors determinations. It is vital that these records provide references and documents concerning specific events that would support these purposes. 2.b. In 2014, reference (d) announced the development and testing of a Marine Corps Electronic Command Chronology Reporting System by the Archives Branch at the Library of the Marine Corps, however, this system was not implemented for use and command chronology submissions remain required for submission via email. 3. Actions. 3.a. Per Appendix A of reference (a), all Fleet Marine Force units down to the battalion/squadron level shall submit command chronologies on a semi-annual basis. All other commands, including all Marine Corps Reserve units, shall submit command chronologies on an annual basis. 3.a.1. Reference (d) established a fiscal year timeline for command chronology submissions effective 1 OCT 2014. This timeline remains in effect. 3.a.2. Annual submissions covering the period from 1 October to 30 September are due no later than (NLT) 31 December each year. 3.a.3. Semi-annual submissions covering the period from 1 October to 31 March are due 30 June, and submissions covering the period from 1 April to 30 September are due NLT 31 December. 3.a.4. In special situations to include operational deployments for combat, units shall submit monthly command chronologies IAW reference (a). 3.a.5. Units shall submit their command chronologies as OCR PDF documents directly to HD by email to History.Division@usmcu.edu. These reports must contain the signature of the commanding officer. By Direction and Acting signatures are not permitted. Digital signatures are not permitted and will not be accepted. HD will verify that each report is complete and issue an email receipt once the report is accepted into the archive. 3.b. Unit commanders shall ensure a staff member is designated in writing to perform the additional duty of Staff Historian IAW reference (a). 3.c. HD has prepared a staff historian/command chronology support webpage containing details on command chronology preparation and submission as well as a sample. Link https:(slash)(slash)www.usmcu. edu/Research/Marine-Corps-History-Division/Information-for-Units/ Command-Chronology-Program/ 3.d. HD shall maintain a report of command chronology submissions to provide unit leaders with awareness on the status of their command chronologies. This report shall be updated monthly and posted on the command chronology support webpage. 3.e. The Inspectors General Checklist for the Marine Corps Historical Program, functional area 5750, is up to date and valid. Although the Marine Corps Historical Program is not designated as a Critical or Required Evaluation (CoRE) functional area under the Inspector General of the Marine Corps (IGMC) Inspections Program, commanders are encouraged to incorporate this functional area into their command inspection programs to ensure their units and subordinate commands are meeting the requirements of reference (a). The Marine Corps Historical Program functional area checklist can be found on the IGMC website at https:(slash)(slash)www.igmc.marines.mil /DIVISIONS/INSPECTIONS-DIVISION/FUNCTIONAL-AREA-CHECKLISTS-FACS/ 4.

This message announces the Command Retention Mission (CRM) for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26). 2. Background. The Marine Corps achieved historic retention rates under the Fiscal Year 2025 CRM, exceeding aggregate missions for both First Term Alignment Plan (FTAP) and career Marines. This success is attributed to leaders at every echelon who worked tirelessly to meet the Commandant's priorities and retain our best talent. With FY25 in hand, the Service seeks to carry the momentum forward into the FY26 Enlisted Retention Campaign. 3. Action. The following Major Commands are assigned a CRM, effective through 30 September 2026: Marine Forces Command Marine Forces Pacific Marine Forces Reserve Marine Forces Cyberspace Command Marine Forces Special Operations Command I Marine Expeditionary Force 1st Marine Division 3d Marine Aircraft Wing 1st Marine Logistics Group II Marine Expeditionary Force 2d Marine Division 2d Marine Aircraft Wing 2d Marine Logistics Group III Marine Expeditionary Force 3d Marine Division 1st Marine Aircraft Wing 3d Marine Logistics Group Marine Corps Installations Command - East Marine Corps Installations Command - West Marine Corps Installations Command - Pacific Marine Corps Installations Command - NCR Training & Education Command Training Command Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command Marine Corps Logistics Command 3.a. Although only Major Subordinate Commands (MSCs) are directly missioned by CMC (MM), commanders, staffs, and leaders at all levels are critical in influencing the retention of the best and most qualified Marines in order to sustain our warfighting capabilities. 3.b. The assigned mission for FY26 will be released via the Total Force Retention System (TFRS). 4. Coordinating Instructions 4.a. The mission assigned to each MSC is linked to the execution of a reenlistment and is not considered fulfilled until each Marine accepts his or her contract. The assigned CRM is considered the minimum requirement; it is imperative that MSCs sustain retention efforts throughout the FY26 Enlisted Retention Campaign. 4.b. The FY26 CRM assigns by-PMOS and aggregate missions to each MSC for the FTAP and Subsequent Term Alignment Plan (STAP). MSCs are also assigned a Direct Affiliation Program (DAP) mission. Assigned missions are based on each MSC's eligible population. 4.b.1. The assigned by-PMOS mission identifies the FTAP and STAP PMOSs which are historically the most challenging for retention. The mission reflects a proportional share of the boatspaces aligned with the proportion of the eligible PMOS population within each MSC. For example, if MSC A has 20 percent of the eligible 0311 Marines, MSC A's mission will be to fill 20 percent of the available boatspaces. 4.b.2. The assigned by-PMOS mission does not preclude MSCs from assigning units additional PMOS requirements based on need. 4.b.3. The aggregate mission is based on the overall retention goal and the MSC's eligible population. The Service will need to reenlist 39.6 percent of the eligible FTAP population and 66.3 percent of the eligible STAP population to meet end-strength requirements for FY26. 4.b.4. The aggregate DAP mission assigned to each MSC is based upon the overall Reserve Component retention goal and each command's eligible FY26 first term Marine population. 4.c. Marines executing a lateral move in conjunction with reenlistment will count as a reenlistment in the PMOS they laterally move into. 4.d. Only Marines with an End of Current Contract (ECC) between 1 October 2025 and 30 September 2026 will count towards the FY26 CRM. For DAP, this population includes officers. Per reference (b), reenlistments secured since the start of the FY26 retention campaign on 1 January 2025 will count towards the CRM. 4.e. The Service's requirement is to fill every boatspace for each FTAP and STAP PMOS with the highest quality Marine. In some cases, the total assigned mission across all MSCs may exceed the authorized boatspace requirement for a PMOS. If a PMOS reaches 100 percent execution of available boatspaces, all commands will be relieved of their mission for that PMOS regardless of whether or not they achieved their originally assigned mission. 4.f. Reenlistment credit for purposes of the CRM will be applied to the MSC where the Marine is assigned upon execution of the reenlistment. Missions may be adjusted on a case-by-case basis to account for Marines who change commands and subsequently reenlist. Commands will receive credit once an approved DAP request is accepted by the eligible Marine. 5. Subsequent updates to the CRM will be released as necessary. 6. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower Management Division.//"

M. DOIN/CIV/PP&O/EMAIL: SARA.M.DOIN(AT)USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/ 1. Purpose. In accordance with ref (A), to increase the overall operations security (OPSEC) awareness and effectiveness across the force by combating complacency, increasing situational awareness of vulnerabilities, and underscoring best practices for all Marines to keep in mind as they go about their warfighting business. 2. As we carry out our daily missions and modernize for the future operating environment under Force Design concepts, it is vital to remember that our success depends not only on our strength and skill but also on our ability to protect the integrity of our operations. Operations security is an essential part of maintaining our tactical advantage, ensuring mission success, safeguarding the safety of every Marine, and enables our contributions to the Joint Force. We must perform OPSEC with the same diligence as other operational tasks. 3. OPSEC is everyone's responsibility. Whether you're deployed in the field, stationed at home, or in transit, your actions can have a direct impact on the security of our unilateral, Joint, and combined operations. Discretion in what we share, where we share it, and with whom we share it is key to preventing adversaries from gaining valuable information. 4. Key Principles to Remember: a) Know Your Critical Information: Understand what information and indicators need protection from the Critical Information and Indicators List (CIIL); be vigilant in how you handle and safeguard this information. Your OPSEC Program Manager is responsible for publishing your commander's CIIL. b) Limit Communication: Be mindful of conversations in public spaces, online platforms, and social media. A simple comment can provide an enemy with a significant advantage. Adversaries can correlate seeming disparate data together with advanced computing that can produce indicators of our activities. c) Monitor Your Surroundings: Always be aware of your environment and potential threats. This includes monitoring communication channels and ensuring that sensitive materials are not exposed. Foreign intelligence entities are employed, paid, and promoted based on their ability to collect USMC information - they are incentivized to steal information from you. d) Report Suspicious Activity: Your reporting of OPSEC violations and possible indicator exposures helps improve the operations security process and ultimately improves the USMC's ability to conduct operations. 5. Best Practices: a) Personal Cell Phones. Personal cell phones are a major vulnerability that adversaries targeting you and your unit can exploit while utilizing a foreign communications network, i.e. while operating overseas. If your command authorizes you to take your personal cell phone, protect your personal information through encryption and virtual private networks to reduce vulnerabilities. b) Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Commercial GPS devices can be spoofed since they lack military encryption, i.e. adversaries falsify the GPS signal - putting you and your fellow Marines at risk during a host of activities that require you to report your position accurately. Many civilian systems, like personal fitness devices, collect, aggregate, and make your location data available for sale and exploitation. Recommend using only Marine Corps approved GPS devices. Remain proficient at using map and compass. c) Geotagging. If you take a digital picture using a personal electronic device, there is metadata associated with that picture. The metadata includes, but is not limited to, the location where the picture was taken, the time, and other identity-related information, and is stored digitally on the file along with other amplifying information. Do not post personal pictures to social media that may reveal sensitive information about Marine Corps operations. A seemingly trivial picture taken while deployed, at an exercise, or aboard a military installation may reveal critical information to an adversary particularly when corroborated or compiled with other adversary collection means. d) Pictures and Videos. Ensure you are aware of what is in the background of pictures and videos before releasing it on social media or to the public and ensure it is cleared through Communication Strategy and Operations (COMMSTRAT), OPSEC and/or the Foreign Disclosure Officer. Be especially careful when taking pictures at military exercises. Maps, computer screens, signs, etc. may reveal Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) or other critical information that may be useful to an adversary, especially when paired with other collection means. Pictures are generally not authorized on military installations or during operations and training. Your commander should provide guidance and identify appropriate security review procedures when photography is necessary. e) Communication Strategy. Ensure all information, pictures, videos, etc. undergo an OPSEC review based off your individual unit's CIIL before releasing to the public. COMMSTRAT personnel can assist with visual information policy and procedures. f) Social Media. Social media is ever present on your devices; many applications persistently collect identifiable information about you, your location, and your associations that can be exploited by adversaries. If you do use social media, utilize U.S. based social media applications, ensure your settings are private, and do not post anything that an adversary may use to ascertain critical information about Marine Corps operations. Avoid applications made by companies that are based in adversary countries/locations or those that have a demonstrated history of poor cyber security. g) Family Awareness. Talk to your family members about OPSEC. They might not even consider the dangers of sharing operational or sensitive information with friends, family, or on social media posts. You may need to have face-to-face conversations about timing and general location of where you are deploying. However, inform your loved ones of what they can and cannot say to others. Speak to your children about how important it is that they keep information about you private. 6. In every action, whether at home station or in the field, prioritize the protection of our operations from passive and active collection by foreign intelligence entities. The safety of our fellow Marines and the success of our mission depend on the security we maintain in all that we do. Stay vigilant, stay secure, and continue to uphold the highest standards of operations security. 7. Points of contact: 7.a.

Per refs (b) and (g), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected. This includes the physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section 10206 of ref (a). Ref (a) requires written notification to the officer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable. Commanding Officers must also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of administrative action. Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation. 4.b. Adverse Screening Process. Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or potentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10) removed the names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL). 5. Retirement and Transfer. Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion. An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component. 6. Accepting and Declining Promotion. Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted). To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade. Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline. 7. For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-9705 or DSN 278-9705. Email inquiries may be submitted via the Officer Promotions homepage at www.Marines.mil. Email address is officerpromotions@usmc.mil. 8. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower Management Division.//"

Marines with exactly 28 years of active service on the date of reenlistment may be paid a Zone G PMOS bonus if they have not previously received a Zone G PMOS bonus. No SRB payment will be paid after the Marine's 28th year of active service. PMOS E8 & ABOVE 0372 50,000 1795 50,000 8412 45,000 6. LM designated PMOSs. 6.a. LM PMOSs are listed under paragraphs 5.a, 5.b, and 5.c with the LM designation. These PMOSs are authorized bonus payments to Marines who execute a LM in conjunction with a reenlistment in their respective Zones. Marines who request LM into a PMOS may submit for reenlistment immediately and do not have to wait until their current PMOSs boatspaces are closed out prior to requesting a LM boatspace. 6.b. Bonus payment for LM PMOSs will not be made at the time of reenlistment but upon successful completion of PMOS training and subsequent award of the PMOS. Bonus payment will be based upon the FY SRB authorized at the time of reenlistment. Marines who are in training beyond 30 September 2026 will be authorized payment of the PMOS bonus once the Marine Corps Total Force System shows they have been awarded the new PMOS. 6.c. Marines who fail to complete required LM PMOS training will be re-designated or administratively separated according to the needs of the Marine Corps and will receive no bonus, even if the PMOS the Marine is reclassified into is eligible to receive one. 7. Administrative Elements. 7.a. Boatspace quotas will only be exceeded upon approval by Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC), Manpower Plans, Policy, and Budget (MPP). Reenlistments approved in excess of boatspace quotas per PMOS may rate a bonus if available funding exists and is authorized by CMC (MPP). Marines are encouraged to reenlist early in the FY26 retention campaign to secure their boatspace and bonus. 7.b. PMOS bonus authority is granted for service in the PMOS. As of the date time group (DTG) of the MARADMIN announcing approved selections to first sergeant/master sergeant, Marines selected to first sergeant will not be eligible to receive a PMOS bonus. Marines eligible for promotion to first sergeant/master sergeant who execute reenlistment prior to the release of the selection MARADMIN will receive a PMOS bonus if eligible. Example: A Zone C 0372 gunnery sergeant who is eligible for promotion and reenlists prior to the DTG of the release of the selection MARADMIN will receive a PMOS bonus of $55,000. Additionally, a Zone C 0372 gunnery sergeant who is selected to master sergeant and reenlists after the DTG of the release of the selection MARADMIN will receive a PMOS bonus of $55,000. However, a Zone C 0372 gunnery sergeant who is selected to first sergeant and reenlists after the DTG of the release of the selection MARADMIN is no longer eligible to receive a PMOS bonus. 7.c. Flat Rate PMOS Bonus. The pre-tax flat rate PMOS bonus amounts authorized are based on the Marine's reenlistment Zone, the Marine's grade on the date of reenlistment, the PMOS for which the Marine is reenlisting, and the kicker or initiative the Marine selects (if any). 7.d. Obligated Service and Computation of PMOS Bonus. The PMOS bonus dollar amount is impacted by the number of months of additional obligated service for which the Marine reenlists. Obligated service is defined as the time between the Marine's ECC at the time of reenlistment and the ECC of the Marine's new contract immediately after reenlistment. Marines who are not eligible for the 72 or 96-month reenlistment incentive must reenlist for a minimum of 48 months of additional obligated service to get the full PMOS bonus. On a case-by-case basis, CMC (MMEA-1) may authorize reenlistment periods of less than 48 months. These Marines will be eligible for a PMOS bonus at a prorated amount if their reenlistment period includes at least 36 months of additional obligated service. Marines who reenlist for less than 36 months of additional obligated service, excluding any initiatives addressed in this MARADMIN, are not eligible for any PMOS bonus. Marines will rate the PMOS bonus applicable to their Zone, their grade, and their MOS as authorized in this MARADMIN. The kickers listed in paragraph 4 of this MARADMIN are only available to 48-month additional obligated service contracts. No prorated amounts on kickers or initiatives will be authorized. (1) Example: A Marine whose ECC is 15 March 2026 and is reenlisting with an effective date of 16 March 2026 will be required to reenlist for 48 months to rate the full 48-month PMOS bonus payment. (2) Example: A Marine whose ECC is 15 March 2026 and is reenlisting with an effective date of 14 March 2026 will be required to reenlist for 49 to rate the full 48-month PMOS bonus payment. (3) Example: Marines reenlisting for other than 48 months of obligated service will rate the number of months of obligated service/48 months x the PMOS bonus authorized rounded to the nearest dollar. An 0231 corporal in Zone A decides to reenlist for 39 months of obligated service, their ECC is 15 December 2025 prior to reenlistment, and after reenlistment their ECC is 15 March 2029. The PMOS bonus authorized will be as follows: 39 months/48 months x $14,000 = $11,375. (4) Example: A sergeant in Zone A reenlists into the 2631 PMOS and reenlists for 60 months of obligated service at time of reenlistment. The PMOS bonus authorized will be limited to the full 48-month PMOS bonus amount of $31,750. Final determination of all bonus recoupment amounts will be made by a disbursing office or the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS). 7.e. SRB Payment Caps. Per reference (a), no Marine will exceed $360,000 in career SRB payments. Example: A Zone A sergeant who successfully LMs into 0211 on a 72-month contract will receive $105,000. That Marine will only rate a total of $255,000 in future bonuses regardless of the amounts published in future SRB MARADMINs. 7.f. Years of Service Calculation. To determine a Marine's years of active military service, the Armed Forces Active-Duty Base Date will be used for all Marines. 7.g. Kicker Limitations. Marines may be eligible for multiple kickers as part of this Program, however Marines will be limited to receiving only one kicker upon reenlistment. (1) Example: A Zone A 6176 corporal that is qualified to receive the Aircraft Maintenance Kicker and eligible for the Aircraft Readiness Kicker. This Marine cannot receive both kickers and will have to choose which kicker to accept, adhering to its corresponding Statement of Understanding. 8. Recoupment Policy. 8.a. Marines who receive an SRB payment will be required to serve in a billet requiring the PMOS or skill for which they received the bonus payment, unless they serve in an authorized out-of-skill assignment, or a waiver is granted by the Secretary of the Navy. Failure to complete this requirement may result in recoupment of the unearned portion of the Marine's reenlistment bonus as stated in reference (a). 8.b. Marines with an approaching ECC who are awaiting the results of a board leading to an officer program or Marines who intend to submit for an officer program should request an extension of their current contract vice reenlistment. Marines who reenlist or extend solely to gain sufficient obligated service to participate in a program leading to a commissioned or warrant officer status are not entitled to an SRB. 8.c. Marines who reenlist in their PMOS or skill then subsequently apply to and are accepted into a program that will change their PMOS or skill or lead to a commission, are not subject to any recoupment of SRB. The term \"apply\" is defined as the date on a Marine's cover letter requesting consideration for one of these type programs. (1) Example: An 0629 staff sergeant in Zone C who reenlisted for 48 months of obligated service during FY24 and received a $4,500 PMOS bonus payment is entitled to keep their entire PMOS bonus payment if they apply for and are selected to become a career recruiter during FY26. (2) Example: An 0369 staff sergeant in Zone B who reenlisted for 48 months of obligated service during FY24 and received a $23,500 PMOS bonus payment is entitled to keep their entire PMOS bonus payment if they apply for and are selected to the MECEP during FY26. 8.d. Marines who apply for a program which will change their PMOS or lead to a commission, then subsequently reenlist within their PMOS will not normally be considered eligible for an SRB and are subject to recoupment of the unearned portion of any SRB payment received. The term \"apply\" is defined as the date on a Marine's cover letter requesting consideration for one of these type programs. (1) Example: An 0861 staff sergeant in Zone B applies to become a career recruiter on 1 January 2026, reenlists for 48 months of obligated service on 1 March 2026 receives a $17,000 PMOS bonus payment, and is accepted/assigned as a career recruiter on 1 June 2026 would have the unexpired portion of obligated service recouped. Recoupment details: 45 months unexpired obligated service/48 months original obligated service x $17,000 PMOS bonus payment received: $15,937 total recoupment. Final determination of all SRB recoupment amounts will be made by a disbursing office or DFAS. 9. Coordinating Instructions. 9.a. The FY26 SRB Program Statement of Understanding is available for download from the Total Force Retention System and the Enlisted Retention Manpower page. References (a) through (d) contain amplifying instruction for the execution of enlisted bonus payments. 9.b. To align with the Return on Investment talent management initiative, the Marine Corps is updating the SRB payment methodology to enhance career stability and retention efforts. 9.c. Marines will have the opportunity to reenlist ahead of their retention cohort year, securing reenlistment incentives, duty station assignments, and career progression opportunities without delay. SRB payments will be made in the fiscal year of their ECC rather than at the time of reenlistment. 9.d. This early enlistment opportunity enables the Marine Corps to execute retention campaigns efficiently while providing Marines with a stable and predictable reenlistment process. The payment methodology ensures Marines continue to receive financial incentives tied to their reenlistment. 9.e. Marines who reenlist under this framework will lock in their bonus eligibility, career assignments, and obligated service while receiving SRB payment in the appropriate fiscal year. In the unlikely event that a Marine does not receive their bonus payment within their designated retention fiscal year, they will have the option to submit for separation within 90 days of concluding FY. 10. If SRB funds are obligated faster than currently planned or a change in retention requirements is necessary, Headquarters, United States Marine Corps will suspend or terminate the FY26 SRB Program as needed prior to 30 September 2026. 11. This MARADMIN is not applicable to the Marine Corps Reserve. 12. Release authorized by Lieutenant General Michael J. Borgschulte, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//"

Under the provisions of section 578 of ref (a) and ref (c), the Secretary of the Navy, acting for the President of the United States, hereby authorizes the promotion of the following named regular officer(s) as indicated, to the permanent grade of Chief Warrant Officer Four (CWO4) and Chief Warrant Officer Three (CWO3). Rank, pay, and allowances are effective from 1 May 2025. Name Grade MCC Timothy A. Taylor CWO4 017 Andrew J. Wenzel CWO3 1CF 6. Delay of Promotion 6.a. Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (h), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected. This includes the physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section 10206 of ref (a). Ref (a) requires written notification to the officer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable. Commanding Officers must also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of administrative action. Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation. 6.b. Adverse Screening Process. Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or potentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10) removed the names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL). 7. Retirement and Transfer. Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion. An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component. 8. Accepting and Declining Promotion. Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 2 through 5 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted). To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade. Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline. 9. The following FY25 promotions are projected for June 2025 and are subject to change. Promotions from the remaining FY25 boards will be promulgated based on vacancy determination and senate confirmation. Senior Officer Sel Junior Officer Sel Col (R) S. E. Anderson 27 A. J.

This MARADMIN provides advance notice of upcoming changes to reference (a) regarding Special Leave Accrual (SLA), as directed in references (b) and (c). These changes will be incorporated into the next revision of reference (a). 2. Key changes. Reference (e) is canceled. Effective immediately, Marines are authorized to carry over a maximum of 90 days of accrued leave from one Fiscal Year (FY) to the next. This includes; Up to 60 days of annual leave and up to 30 days of SLA IAW the provisions of this MARADMIN. 3. Definitions. 3.a. Accrued Leave Balance. Consists of both annual leave and SLA. Marines accrue leave at a rate of 2.5 days per month. Accrued leave is also referred to as \"earned leave.\" 3.b. Annual Leave. Regular leave granted under a command's leave program, charged against the Marine's accrued leave balance. Unless authorized SLA, a Marine can carry over a maximum of 60 days of annual leave from one FY to the next. 3.c. SLA. Restored accrued leave in excess of the maximum annual leave that may be carried forward from one FY to the next. SLA is only authorized under specific conditions outlined in paragraph 6 of this MARADMIN. 4. SLA Expiration. Approved SLA will be forfeited if not used by the end of the second FY after the qualifying duty ends. For example, if a Marine has approved SLA in FY23, they must use it by the end of FY25, or it will be lost. 5. Approval Authority and Record Keeping. 5.a. SLA requests that meet criteria must be authorized in writing by the first Marine general officer in the Marine's administrative chain of command. 5.b. MOL Reporting. Once approved, commanders will report SLA details into Marine OnLine (MOL). 5.c. Records. The Marine's administrative chain of command will retain a copy of all approved SLA requests and ensure the final determination from the first Marine general officer in the Marine's administrative chain of command is uploaded into the Marine's Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). 6. Qualifying Duties. 6.a. Hostile Fire or Imminent Danger Area. Serving at least 120 days continuously in a location designated for Hostile Fire or Imminent Danger Pay. 6.b. Deployable Ship or Mobile Unit. Serving on a deployable ship or with a mobile unit of the Operating Forces where the duty location prevents using earned leave before it expires at the end of the FY. 6.c. Other duty. Serving at least 120 continuous days in other prescribed duties where leave is restricted due to catastrophes, national emergencies, crises, and/or operations in defense of national security. Circumstances must exist preventing the Marine from reducing their leave balance to 60 days before the end of the FY (i.e., they are officially denied the opportunity to take leave). 6.d. Contingency Operations. Marines assigned to units, headquarters, or supporting staff may be eligible for SLA if their leave is restricted due to direct involvement in a designated contingency operation. 7. Transition Period. 7.a. Marines with SLA exceeding 90 days on 31 December 2022 (COVID-19 excess leave) must use or lose it by 30 September 2026. 7.b. Marines will not be authorized additional SLA until their SLA balance is below 30 days. 7.c. Marines can find their SLA balance and FY expiration date on their Leave and Earnings Statement (LES). 8. One-time SLA Sell Back. 8.a. In accordance with reference (d), enlisted Marines losing accrued leave in excess of 90 days may elect to sell back up to 30 days of SLA. By law, this option does not apply to officers. 8.b. To qualify, an enlisted Marine must have leave exceeding 90 days, and if not for the new authorized accrued leave balance limit, it would have been restored as SLA. 8.c. Marines electing to sell back SLA must submit supporting documentation through MOL to their administrative chain of command; requests will include verification that leave exceeding 90 days would have qualified for SLA (i.e., leave was approved for SLA but cannot be restored due to exceeding the 90-day accrued leave limit balance). 8.d. An enlisted Marine may only make this election once. 8.e. SLA sell-back counts towards the 60-day limit on total sell-back days an enlisted Marine has over their career. 9. All questions concerning SLA should be directed to the Marines' administration section or their local Installation Personnel Administration Center (IPAC). 10. This MARADMIN only applies to Active Duty and Active Reserve Marines. 11. Release authorized by Brigadier General David R. Everly, Director, Manpower Plans and Policy Division.//"

Inform Marine Corps judge advocates and civilian attorneys working under the cognizance of the Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the Marine Corps (SJA to CMC) of the reimbursement program for their annual professional licensing fees. References (a) through (i) provide authority for government payment of professional credentials, licenses, and certifications for judge advocates and civilian attorneys who are practicing law under the cognizance of the SJA to CMC. 2. This MARADMIN does not replace existing command licensing fee reimbursement programs. Civilian attorneys may alternatively seek reimbursement from local commands. 3. The term \"attorney\" throughout this MARADMIN is used for ease of reference and pertains to: 3.a. Judge advocates in the Active, Active Reserve, Selected Marine Corps Reserve, Individual Mobilization Augmentation Detachment, Individual Ready Reserve components, and 3.b. Civilian attorneys practicing law under the cognizance of the SJA to CMC. 4. Eligibility. The following attorneys are eligible to apply for reimbursement: 4.a. All Active and Active Reserve judge advocates are eligible for reimbursement under this program, except those who, at the time of application, have an approved separation or retirement date in fiscal year 2025. 4.b. Judge advocates in the Reserve, Selected Marine Corps Reserve, Individual Mobilization Augmentation Detachment, and Individual Ready Reserve are eligible if they have served, or are projected to serve, over 179 days in fiscal year 2025. Reimbursement is not authorized for a qualifying expense that has been or will be paid, directly or through reimbursement, by the judge advocate's civilian employer. 4.c. Civilians employed as attorneys operating under the cognizance of the SJA to CMC and paid with appropriated funds are eligible. However, those who, at the time of application, have an established separation, transfer, or retirement date in fiscal year 2025 are not eligible. If a civilian attorney was hired in fiscal year 2025, then the civilian attorney must have worked at least 179 days in fiscal year 2025 in order to qualify for reimbursement. Non-appropriated fund employees, local national employees, and political appointees are not eligible. Civilian attorneys may alternatively seek reimbursement from local commands. 5. Qualifying Expenses. 5.a. Attorneys may be reimbursed up to $500 once each fiscal year for the costs of active (or equivalent) membership in a state or U.S. territory bar association incurred while in military service or employment with the Marine Corps. Attorneys may be reimbursed for dues paid to a maximum of two bar associations. If an attorney is a member of two bar associations, and one association waives or reduces dues for active-duty service, the attorney may still claim reimbursement for dues paid to both associations, up to the $500 limit. Membership in a jurisdiction's bar association may be reimbursed only if the jurisdiction requires such membership in order to practice law in their jurisdiction. 5.b. Attorneys who pay bar association membership fees, either annually or biennially (e.g., every two years), may request reimbursement during the fiscal year in which they pay the fees. 5.c. Mandatory charges associated with bar association membership in active (or equivalent) status are reimbursable, including periodic dues and universally-assessed fees and surcharges. However, reimbursement of expenses associated with obtaining academic degrees (including Juris Doctorate and Master of Laws degrees) or maintaining membership in optional professional societies or bar sections is not authorized. The following are also unauthorized expenses: examination preparation courses, examination fees, any voluntary fee or donation, costs for continuing legal education (CLE) events or materials, CLE waiver fees, payments in lieu of CLE, online payment or processing fees (unless online payment is mandatory), convenience fees, late fees, fees for more than one bar association membership, travel costs, or costs incurred to obtain other professional licenses. 5.d. For Reserve and Selected Marine Corps Reserve judge advocates, reimbursement is not authorized for a qualifying expense that has been or will be paid, directly or through reimbursement, by the judge advocate's civilian employer. 5.e. Reimbursement is only authorized for qualifying expenses incurred after appointment as a judge advocate. 5.f. For fiscal year 2025, reimbursement will be limited to up to $500 per attorney and is subject to the availability of funds. 6. Process. 6.a. Judge Advocate Division will begin accepting reimbursement requests on 15 April 2025, and will continue accepting requests through 11 July 2025. Requests will not be accepted after 11 July 2025. 6.b.

Judge Advocate Division will review and approve reimbursement requests on a rolling basis as they are received, beginning in April 2025 and continuing through the review of all requests received prior to 11 July 2025. 7. Discretionary Payment. Reimbursement is discretionary and subject to the availability of funds. This MARADMIN does not create an entitlement or benefit of employment. Continued payment of licensing fees is not guaranteed in future years and this MARADMIN will be reviewed and modified as required annually. 8. Additional questions should be directed to the POC. 9. Release authorized by Major General David J. Bligh, Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the Marine Corps.//"

REF B IS MCO 3040.4, THE MARINE CORPS CASUALTY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.// POC/JASON G. ATTEMA/GS-12/MFPC/TEL: 703-784-9512/ EMAIL: JASON.G.ATTEMA@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. This MARADMIN announces the mandatory Marine Corps-wide transition to the use of Department of Defense casualty reporting software, Defense Casualty Information Processing System-Personnel Casualty Report (DCIPS-PCR) spreadsheet method, for receiving and disseminating casualty reports. Additionally, this MARADMIN cancels reference (a) and further clarifies reporting requirements previously published in chapter 3 of reference (b). 2. The DCIPS-PCR spreadsheet method replaces DCIPS-8.0 (also known as DCIPS-Forward) as the sole authorized method for submitting Personnel Casualty Reports (PCR) throughout the Marine Corps, effective immediately. This new casualty reporting process is mandated due to the end-of-service life of the DCIPS-8.0 software. The transition to the DCIPS-PCR spreadsheet simplifies the casualty reporting process, provides considerable flexibility for reporting in unique and dynamic situations, and reduces the administrative burden for reporting units. 3. The casualty reporting procedures for DCIPS 8.0 are no longer in effect. Instructions, training materials, and casualty report templates for submitting reports are available on the casualty manpower website at https: (slash)(slash)www.manpower.marines.mil (slash)Marine-and-Family-Programs(slash)Military-Personnel- Services(slash), and through the Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) Casualty Section (MFPC) DCIPS-PCR Transition Microsoft Teams channel. 4. The DCIPS-PCR spreadsheet establishes two methods for reporting casualties to MFPC: Method One for singular casualties and Method Two for multiple casualties. When reporting an individual casualty, use the Method One template. The individual spreadsheet used for initial reports must be used to create Status Change Reports (STACH), Progress Reports (PROG), or Supplemental Reports (SUPP). STACH, PROG, or SUPP reports will be documented by adding a new column to the existing spreadsheet and updating report data. All reports will be submitted to HQMC via email to the casualty OMB casualty.section@usmc.mil. For reporting multiple casualty incidents, use the Method Two template. This method is specifically designed for the initial reporting of mass casualty events involving five or more casualties. After units provide the initial report using Method Two, an individual report for each casualty must be submitted to HQMC using Method One. These procedures enable the immediate reporting of mass casualty events without unnecessary administrative delays. HQMC will not accept any reports submitted directly through the DCIPS-PCR web portal. PCRs will only be processed if they are submitted according to the guidance provided on the Casualty Manpower website or Microsoft Teams Channel. 5. MFPC will upload the processed PCR into DCIPS-PCR and provide a finalized report to the reporting unit. This report will serve as the unit's historical record for casualty affairs program inspection purposes. 6. The updated reporting procedures do not relieve units, once informed of a reportable garrison casualty, from the obligation to provide MFPC with a voice report as soon as made aware of the situation per reference (b). The timeframe for submitting the required voice report has been shortened from one hour to 30 minutes. Additionally, the relevant casualty template must be submitted for review to casualty.section@usmc.mil within one hour. Delays in reporting due to reviews and approvals from individuals outside of the immediate command are not valid justifications for failing to meet timelines. MFPC will make the final determination of the content requirements within a PCR. 7. Training sessions will be scheduled, and dates will be announced via the HQMC, MFPC DCIPS-PCR Transition Teams channel (dates TBA within the channel). The Teams link can be found on the Casualty Manpower site under the provided link. 8. Questions may be sent via email to casualty.section@usmc.mil or via phone at (703)784-9512, option 1. 9. This MARADMIN applies to the reporting of all Marine Corps casualties. 10. Release authorized by Lieutenant General Michael J. Borgschulte, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//"

The Marine Corps continues to update procedures and guidance to ensure clarity and alignment with promotion policies. Over time, various Marine Administrative Messages (MARADMINs) have introduced incremental changes, some of which are now obsolete due to policy updates, including release of Marine Corps Order 1616.1, Junior Enlisted Performance Evaluation System (JEPES), in 2020. To eliminate outdated guidance and provide Marines with clear and relevant policies, five MARADMINs require cancellation. These MARADMINs have either been incorporated into existing orders or superseded by more recent changes, such as updates to time-in-grade (TIG) and time-in-service (TIS) requirements, JEPES score calculations, and board submission processes. Canceling these obsolete MARADMINs will prevent confusion and reinforce a streamlined, up-to-date promotion policy framework. The following five MARADMINs are canceled: 1.a. MARADMIN 285/05. Guidance has been incorporated into reference (a). 1.b. MARADMIN 055/16. Superseding messages made the MARADMIN obsolete. The following minimum TIG and TIS requirements apply for promotion and will be incorporated into reference (a). Regular Promotion Meritorious Promotion Grade Promoted To TIG TIS TIG TIS SgtMaj/MGySgt 3 YRS 10 YRS N/A N/A 1stSgt/MSgt 4 YRS 8 YRS N/A N/A GySgt 3 YRS 6 YRS N/A 6 YRS SSgt 3 YRS 5 YRS N/A 4 YRS Sgt 12 MOS 4 YRS (Note 1) N/A 18 MOS Cpl 12 MOS 12 MOS N/A 6 MOS LCpl 8 MOS 9 MOS N/A N/A PFC 6 MOS 6 MOS N/A N/A Note 1: Cpls who meet the conditions outlined in reference (b) are authorized promotion to Sgt with a TIS of three years. 1.c. MARADMIN 200/16. There is no requirement to conduct promotion panels prior to recommending a Marine for promotion. 1.c.1. It is still incumbent upon commanders to personally invest themselves in the process of noncommissioned officer (NCO) promotions to ensure Marines not only meet the Commandant's intent, but to ensure the integrity of our valued NCO Corps for today and into the future. 1.c.2. To ensure Marines are not left in a prolonged NOT RECOMMENDED (non-rec) status, Commanders will establish internal control measures to review Marines. At a minimum, commanders will review non-rec status during the semiannual junior enlisted performance evaluation occasion. Commanders may establish stricter procedures as promotions scores occur monthly. These internal control measures are inspectable by the Marine Corps Administrative Analysis Team and justification for Marines left in a non-rec status for longer than three months is required. 1.d. MARADMIN 077/18. Superseding messages and incorporation of policy in reference (c) made the MARADMIN obsolete. 1.e. MARADMIN 329/18. Superseding messages and incorporation of policy in reference (c) made the MARADMIN obsolete. 2. Until reference (a) is updated, this MARADMIN will be used as the official source to signify that all Marines, active and reserve, selected to the ranks of Staff Sergeant through Sergeant Major either for regular or meritorious promotion shall have 24 months obligated service remaining on contract on the date of promotion. 3. For Marine enlisted promotion matters, call (703) 784-3962 or DSN 278-3962. E-mail inquiries to enlistedpromotions@usmc.mil. 4. This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force. 5.

Each type has a unique intent and will be conducted during a deliberate window to optimize the quality of counseling service provided to the officer. 2.a. Board Preparation and Record Audit counselings will be offered between March and May 2025. These sessions are intended to help Officers prepare their records for a selection board or panel. Monitors will discuss an officer's record and performance, as well as their career timing and progression. These sessions will not discuss future assignments, vacancy lists, or duty station preferences. Officers are encouraged to schedule a board preparation and record audit counseling at least two years prior to their in-zone look.

This message announces the timeline for the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Recruiting Station Commanding Officer (RSCO) Selection Board, outlines eligibility criteria, provides information on board communication, and lists the available recruiting stations for assignment. 1.a. Major timeline milestones (read in two columns): Date Milestone Release of this message RSCO questionnaire opens 1 May 2025 Completed questionnaire due 1 May 2025 Remove by request (RBR) due 2 June 2025 RSCO Selection Board convenes TBD July 2025 RSCO Selection Board results released 1.b. Recruiting continues to be one of the most demanding missions facing the Marine Corps. Despite the challenges, the Marine Corps' continued success is a testament to the high quality of Marines assigned to recruiting duty. The Marine Corps provides the opportunity to lead these remarkable Marines to officers who have demonstrated great leadership performance. Selection as an RSCO is a unique distinction with tremendous opportunity to shape the future of the Marine Corps and to develop both professionally and personally. Successful tours indicate outstanding leadership ability, which is acknowledged via higher selection percentages than peers for future command opportunities. In the past five years 64 percent of successful RSCOs were selected as primaries for Lieutenant Colonel command versus a 23 percent selection rate overall. 2. Process. The board will select those who are best and fully qualified from the eligible population. The board will select a number of primaries equal to the number of available recruiting stations and a sufficient number of alternates to meet requirements when primary selects cannot take command. Manpower Management Division will release the results via Marine Administrative (MARADMIN) message. 2.a. Board composition. The RSCO board will be composed of 3 general officers and 13 colonels to ensure a broad professional perspective among the board membership. 3. Eligibility criteria. Active-duty officers who meet the below criteria will be screened for RSCO duty: 3.a. Majors and Majors (select) with a date of rank of 1 September 2024 or junior who will meet their minimum tour control factor (TCF) by 1 September 2026. 3.a.1. Captains in-zone for promotion to Major in Calendar Year 2025/Fiscal Year 2027. 3.b. Eligibility rosters can be found on the following website under MMOA-3 Top Level Schools and Programs Tab in the Recruiting Station Commanding Officer sub-folder: https://www.manpower.marines. mil/Manpower-Management/Officer-Assignments/#tab/top-level-schools-a nd-programs 4. Ineligibility criteria 4.a. Officers with an established separation or retirement date. 4.b. Officers in receipt of orders with a TCF greater than 12 months. 4.c. Limited duty officers. 4.d. Officers selected for or currently attending programs with a designated utilization tour. Examples include, but are not limited to: Graduate Education Programs (GEPs), Test Pilot, Foreign Area Officer (FAO)/Regional Area Officer (RAO), School of Advanced Warfighting and joint equivalents, and Funded Law. 4.e. Officers with an approved lateral move in FY26. 4.f. Naval aviators completing two or more consecutive years in Duty in Flight Status, All Flight Activity Denied (DIFDEN) status during FY26 will not normally be screened for RSCO duty. 5. Volunteers. An officer who does not meet the eligibility criteria or meets one or more of the ineligibility criteria and desires to screen may request screening by submitting an exception to policy (ETP) via an NAVMC 10274 Administrative Action (AA) form to the Plans, Programs, and Boards Section (MMOA-3) via email. The AA form must include why the officer desires to screen and the specific eligibility/ineligibility criteria that they do not/do meet. The AA form must be favorably endorsed by the first O-5 commanding officer in the Marine's chain of command and must receive concurrence from the PMOS monitor via email. Not meeting date of rank requirements is an example of a ETP that MMOA will consider. 6. Board communication 6.a. All eligible officers are directed to communicate their recruiting station duty preferences via the online questionnaire located at: https://www2.manpower.usmc.mil/application_cac/edu/ ViewBoardServlet.action?boardID=4886 6.b. Officers may submit any material not found in their Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) via the questionnaire. Instructions on how to upload material are provided on the final page of the questionnaire. Officers who experience difficulty with the questionnaire upload process should contact Manpower Management Officer Assignments Branch, Plans, Programs, and Boards Section (MMOA-3) by email at smb_mmoa_planso@usmc.mil or by phone at (703) 784-9284 for assistance. 6.c. The deadline for submitting the online questionnaire is 2359 EST on 1 May 2025 in order to facilitate pre-board actions. 6.d. Any correspondence submitted after 1 May 2025 will be considered at the discretion of the board president. 6.e. OMPF update material. Officers should submit OMPF update requests via OMPF-Records Management Application (O-RMA). If assistance is required, contact your unit S-1 or local IPAC. Officers are responsible for ensuring their OMPF is accurate at all times. The RSCO selection board will have access to the member's OMPF. 6.f. The RSCO selection board does not use photographs per reference (c). 6.g. Fitness reports. Completed fitness reports must be submitted to Performance Evaluation Section (MMRP-30) for inclusion into the OMPF. Incomplete fitness reports will not normally be accepted or forwarded to the board. 6.h. Remove by request (RBR) 6.h.1. Officers who are eligible but do not desire to screen for a compelling reason must complete the online questionnaire and attach a AA form requesting RBR. The AA form must state the reason the officer desires to RBR and be favorably endorsed by the first general officer in the Marine's chain of command. MMOA does not consider perceived key billet or career progression concerns as viable reasons for RBR since service as an RSCO is a career- enhancing assignment. The board will screen officers without properly endorsed AA forms. 6.h.2. Director, Manpower Management will review all AA forms requesting RBR and will approve or deny the requests. Prior to the convening of the board, MMOA-3 will notify all officers who submitted an RBR whether their request was approved or denied. 6.h.3. MMOA-3 must receive RBRs via the online questionnaire no later than 2359 EST on 1 May 2025. Officers requesting RBR must also email a copy to their PMOS monitor. 7. Billet vacancies.

MMOA-3 will post an alphabetical list of alternates on the MMOA-3 website following the release of the board results. 8.b. Declinations. Officers who decline command must submit a declination in writing (AA Form) via the first general officer in their chain of command addressed to HQMC via MMOA-3.

Officers who decline command are ineligible for future command at any rank, unless otherwise approved by the Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. 8.c. Deferrals. Officers selected for command who are unable to execute orders due to extraordinary circumstances may request a deferral. If approved, the Director, Manpower Management will defer the officer to a future RSCO selection board.

Per MARADMIN 371/03, officers who successfully complete a tour of duty as an RSCO and meet the eligibility requirements will have the option of either attending Marine Corps Command and Staff College (USMC CSC) without screening on the Commandant's Professional Intermediate Education Board (CPIB) or screening on the board for other CPIB opportunities. Officers who complete their RSCO tour of duty as a lieutenant colonel (select) may opt to compete for fellowship opportunities. Lieutenant colonels (select) should address their preferences with their PMOS monitor. Officers who do not desire to attend resident USMC CSC or to compete for other CPIB programs will have the option of geo-location preference (East Coast, West Coast, National Capitol Region, Hawaii, overseas) for their follow-on duty assignment. 9.

Application process 8.a. The deadline for submitting the application and updated material for the BSPs is 1 May 2025, 2359 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). The online website for submission of all applications and materials is https:(SLASH)(SLASH)www2.manpower.usmc.mil/application_cac/. Officers with an M&RA portal account will proceed to the login process. Officers who do not have a Manpower and Reserve Affairs portal account will receive a 404 access error. Within the error message are instructions on how to register for a Manpower and Reserve Affairs portal account. Any active or reserve component Marines requesting a portal account will be automatically approved. Upon login, the system will validate the application for which the officer is qualified. Click \"RPME-C\" and complete the Reserve Professional Military Education (RPME) application for the desired program. Officers are strongly advised to read the instructions in their entirety before completing the application form. The web-based application allows for the attachment of documents and offers RPME preference options via drop-down boxes. Ensure upload of documents into the proper document type (e.g., Reserve Qualification Summary (RQS) documents upload into RQS file type). Officers must complete, sign (digitally or physically), and attach their RQS NAVMC 10476 (Rev. Sep 2016), which is the current version located on the online application and on the Reserve Affairs Management-3 webpage in order for their application to be considered. All applicants applying for funded BSP must also attach a signed SWAT which is located on the application website, in order for their application to be considered. Once submitted, officers will receive a confirmation email their application has been received. Hard copy applications will not be accepted. All submitted material will be destroyed upon completion of the selection process. If unable to access the portal, email the CDET RLO at mcu_cdet_rlo@usmcu.edu. Active Reserve program members will not submit applications through the M&RA portal and must apply via the CDET RLO. 8.b. Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) material. Any documents that an officer feels should be part of his or her OMPF, other than fitness reports, must be forwarded to HQMC (MMRP-20) by 30 April 2025, 2359 EDT. Email is the preferred and fastest way to update OMPF. Email updated material to smb.manpower.mmsb-20@usmc.mil. In the text of the email, indicate \"AY 25-26 RPME-C\" selection process as the program being considered for. A single black and white multi-page attachment in Adobe Portable Document Format will expedite filing. Ensure all materials contain full name and electronic data interchange personal identifier. Personally identifiable information privacy is the responsibility of the sender. 9. Administration 9.a. Ensure email addresses and telephone numbers are current and are provided on the application. Update any changes to point of contact information promptly. 9.b. Excess Billet Identification Code (BIC). To avoid a break in SELRES affiliation while enrolled in nonresident PME, SMCR Marines may elect to request transfer to an excess BIC within their unit in accordance with reference (e). 9. Notification of selection. The selection panel will select a number of officers as primaries equal to the number of school seats available. The selection panel will also select a sufficient number of officers as alternates to meet quota requirements when officers decline or otherwise cannot accept. Once the results are approved by CDET, primary selectees for the BSP will be notified via email. The email will provide administrative guidance for orders processing and issuance. 10. Withdrawal from course. Officers withdrawing from a course for which they were selected must do so 60 days prior to the commencement of the course. Withdrawal within 60 days of the commencement of the course will be documented in the officer's OMPF with a non-punitive page 11 entry. 11. This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Reserve (AR, SMCR, IMA, and IRR) and has been coordinated with Marine Forces Reserve. 12. Release authorized by Brigadier General Matthew W. Tracy, President, Marine Corps University.//"

Our Nation's strong legacy of volunteerism is one that resonates with every Marine's drive for selfless service. Volunteerism isn't merely community service; it sharpens our readiness and enriches our connections to communities. In FY24, the Volunteer Management Program connected Marines, Sailors, and families to volunteer service opportunities where they collectively volunteered over 175,000 hours. Specifically, active duty members contributed 60,344 hours, family members 44,297 hours, and civilian volunteers 71,015 hours. Additionally, 594 Marines and Sailors earned the Presidential Volunteer Service Award. 2. In April 2025, we celebrate National Volunteer Month. Commanders are encouraged to support the 11th Annual Single Marine Program (SMP) Days of Service, taking place Sunday, 20 April through Saturday, 26 April 2025. All Marines and Sailors are invited to participate in volunteer activities. Commands should ensure these opportunities are made available especially to our Single Marines and Sailors, but not to interfere with regular duties. 3. Recognizing volunteers inspires others to serve and strengthens our Corps. For event details, contact your Installation Volunteer Coordinator or SMP Coordinator. 4. Volunteers exemplify the very best of our Nation and our Corps. Trish and I thank you for your selfless dedication and outstanding contributions. 5. Semper Fidelis, Eric M. Smith, General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.//"

Officers who have more than 18 years of creditable service towards a reserve retirement. 5. Reserve officers participating in any funded PME program of study (excluding two week staff training courses) will incur a Selected Reserve (SELRES) drilling affiliation obligation for 24 continuous months following the completion of the program of study. This requirement is to ensure that the reserve component effectively realizes a return on the investment made in funding the education of officers through these programs. To more effectively enforce this requirement, the following applies: 5.a. Officers will sign a Separate Written Agreement to Train (SWAT) at the time of application to all funded DEP PME programs of study to acknowledge and accept the SELRES drilling affiliation requirement. DEP applications submitted without a signed SWAT will not be accepted. 5.b. 90 days following graduation, officers must be joined to either a SMCR drilling unit or an IMA Billet Identification Code (BIC) that matches their grade and military occupational specialty. 5.c.

CDET WSP student application. 7.b.2. SWAT, initialed and signed by the applicant, and witnessed by a commissioned officer. 7.c. All application packages will be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF) via email to MCU_CDET_RLO@usmcu.edu. 8. Administration 8.a. Excess BIC. To avoid a break in SELRES affiliation while enrolled in nonresident PME, SMCR Marines may elect to request transfer to an excess BIC within their unit in accordance with reference (e). 8.b. Ensure email addresses and telephone numbers are current and are provided on the application. Update any changes to personal contact information promptly to the CDET Reserve Liaison Officer via email to MCU_CDET_RLO@usmcu.edu or via phone at (703) 784-3015. 8.c. Notification of selection. All applications will be screened and selected based off a first-come, first-served policy. The number of funded seats available in an AY will be determined by Marine Forces Reserve. Applications screenings and selectee notifications occur monthly. In September of each year, all selected applicants will be provided administrative guidance via email for orders processing and issuance. 8.d. Seminar Location. Each selectee will be assigned a seminar location based on current CDET business practices. 9. This MARADMIN is applicable to the reserve component (SMCR, IMA, and IRR members) and has been coordinated with MFR. 10. Release authorized by Brigadier General Matthew W.

Purpose: This MARADMIN provides guidance for unserviceable General Service Administration (GSA) containers and vault doors. 2. Background: Command Security Managers and Special Security Officers maintain containers and vault doors for the protection of classified information. The Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) has determined that GSA containers and vault doors manufactured prior to 1989 no longer meet the standards for protection of classified material and cannot be repaired/updated for continued use. All pre-1989 GSA containers must be removed from service NLT 1 October 2028, and vault doors NLT 1 October 2035. 3. Execution: 3.a. Authorities. 3.a.1. Reference (b) and (c) only apply to GSA containers and vault doors used for the protection of classified information. Containers and vault doors used for protection of AA&E are not subject to this requirement. 3.a.2. Per references (b) and (c), class five and six containers and class five vault doors manufactured prior to 1989 no longer meet the standards for protection of classified material and must be removed from service. These containers and vault doors may be visually identified by black lettering on the silver GSA approval label and are commonly referred to as \"black label\" containers or doors. The phase out of \"black label\" containers must be complete NLT 1 October 2028. 3.a.3. Reference (c) extends the phase out for \"black label\" vault doors to 1 October 2035. 3.b. NLT 30 April 2025, Command Security Managers and Special Security Officers will inventory all GSA containers and vault doors under their control, recommend consolidation of classified information where practical, formulate a plan for purchase of new GSA containers where necessary, and begin disposal of all black label containers ensuring that all black label containers are removed from service NLT than 1 October 2028. 3.b.1. NLT 31 May, 2025, commands will identify GSA approved black label vault doors to the servicing facilities office and coordinate necessary actions to remove and replace the vault door NLT 1 October 2035. 3.c. During the phase out period, black label containers may not be repaired. As directed in reference (d), neutralization of a locked-out container and replacement of the lock is considered a repair and is no longer authorized. Locked out black label containers will be neutralized and removed from service per paragraph 3.d.8. below. Reference (d) does provide for certain limited and minor field adjustments which do not meet the definition of a repair. GSA certified inspectors and technicians can assist in determining if these adjustments are authorized for the container in question. 3.d. Procedure for containers. 3.d.1. Command Security Managers and Special Security Officers will coordinate consolidation of classified material into GSA containers manufactured after 1989. These containers can be visually identified by red lettering on the GSA approval label. Where purchase of new containers is required, follow the procedures in para 3.d.8 of this MARADMIN. Due to the high cost and long lead time for procurement of new containers, purchases should be included in the command's budgetary cycle. 3.d.2. Where a container has been recertified, that container will always be identified by black lettering on the GSA approval label; however, the label will specifically state \"recertified container\". The servicing GSA inspector will indicate the original label color on the recertification label and this original color will be used when complying with reference (b). 3.d.3. Any uncertainty regarding the container manufacture date may be confirmed from information found on the manufacturer's label which can be located on one side or the other of the control drawer when open, or on the back of the door for GSA approved vault doors. The manufacturer's label will include the container's class and date of manufacture along with other data. 3.d.4. Where there are continued concerns over a container or vault door, commands may obtain installation or local locksmith services provided the responding locksmith has the proper GSA credentials. 3.d.5. Commands are reminded that GSA containers with blue lettering on the GSA approval label may only to be used for the storage of classified ADP equipment such as classified servers and may not be used for the storage of hard copy classified material. 3.d.6. Where black label containers containing the current model high security lock the commands may elect to repurpose the lock for use on future repairs of post 1989 containers. The approved high security locks are the Kaba X10 and the Sergeant and Greenleaf S&G 2740. Approved locks may be removed by GSA certified locksmiths and retained for reuse. Kaba X07, X08, and X09 locks may not be repurposed and will be disposed of with the container or vault door. For assistance with lock identification review the security hardware section of the DOD Lock Program noted in paragraph 3.d.8 below. 3.d.7. To dispose of unserviceable containers the Command Security Manager and/or Special Security Officer will inspect the container to ensure no classified material remains inside, reset the lock combination to the \"out of service\" combination of 50-25-50, and remove the GSA approval label. Dispose of the container per reference (e) using a condition code of \"S\" for scrap. Disposal of vault doors will be included in the planning for door replacement. 3.d.8. IAW reference (f), new GSA containers and vault doors may only be purchased through GSA global supply. NSNs and instructions for procurement of new GSA containers and vault doors may be found on the DOD Lock Program website at https:(Slash)(Slash)exwc.navfac. navy.mil/DoD-Lock-Program/Security\u00adHardware/ GSA-Approved -Security-Containers. When ordering new containers and vault doors ensure use of the correct NSN for the desired lock type. Style, one locks are the Kaba X10, style two locks are the S&G 2740. 3.d.9. Assistance in locating a GSA certified locksmith, inspector, or technician may be found from any of the following sources: The DOD Lock Program website; Kaba Mas (X10): www.kabamas.com; Sergeant and Greenleaf (S&G 2740): www.sargentandgreenleaf.com/ product/2740b/; GSA approved training centers: Lockmasters Security Institute: 859-887-9633, or MBA USA: 859-887-0496 4. Reporting requirements. 4.a. All actions and documentation required by this MARADMIN will be held locally. Compliance with this MARADMIN will be added to the functional area checklist 5510.3 and included in all future inspections though October 2028 for containers, October 2035 for vault doors. 5. Direct all questions to this MARADMIN's point of contact. 6. Release authorized by Lieutenant General M. G. Carter, Deputy Commandant for Information, U.S. Marine Corps.//"

The FY26 RCSB and RSLB will convene 18 August 2025 for Reserve Component (RC) lieutenant colonels (LtCol) and 25 August 2025 for RC colonels (Col). The board will select RC officers for designated commands/Reserve Senior Leader (RSL) billets projected to be vacated between 1 October 2025 and 30 September 2026. RSL billets are not designated command billets, but they entail significant responsibility. Therefore, applicants applying for RSL billets are governed by the same competitive criteria. 2. Purpose. Per reference (a), the Reserve Command Screening Program (RCSP) ensures Marines receive the best possible leadership and provides eligible officers with a fair and equitable opportunity to command and maintain a competent and well-trained fighting force. 3. Board Process. The boards will select a number of officers equal to the number of commands available. Additionally, the boards will select a sufficient number of officers as alternates to meet command requirements if primaries decline or otherwise cannot take command. The boards will develop proposed command slates for the primary selectees and will forward those slates, along with the alternates list, to the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) for approval. Once the proposed slate and list are approved, board results listing the primary selectees will be announced via Marine Administrative (MARADMIN) message. The alternates list will remain valid until the convening of the next command screening board. Both primary and alternate lists will be posted on the RAM-3 website at https:(slash)(slash)www.manpower.marines.mil/Manpower- Management/Reserve-Affairs-Division/Reserve-Affairs-Management-RAM under the \"Reserve Programs and Boards (RAM-3)\" tab and \"Reserve Officer Command Screening Program\" dropdown menu. 4.

Senior Reserve Advisor billets do not require an up-chit. 6. The boards will select officers who are best and fully qualified for command from a list of eligible LtCols (including LtCol selects) and Cols (including Col selects). 7. Ineligibility.

The colonel through major promotion boards will consider three categories of officers: above-zone, in-zone, and below-zone. For promotion to the grade of captain, AFQOL eligible officers will undergo an AFQOL selection process. Officers defined as active-duty list (ADL) in reference (b) on the date the board or process convenes are eligible for the boards. Officers with established separation/retirement dates within 90 days of the convening date of their respective board (except first lieutenants eligible for the captain AFQOL screening process) will not be considered by the board if the separation/retirement date is established by 2359 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the day before the board convenes. Captains who are not U.S. citizens will not be considered for promotion to major. Officers whose lineal control number (LCN) precedes the senior officer in-zone are defined as above-zone. Those above-zone officers who have not been previously considered are defined as \"above-zone, not previously considered.\" Officers in this status are considered by the board to be in-zone. Officers may review reference (b) and their eligibility for the board or process on the internet at the officer promotion homepage.

This information provides officers with an approximate indication of when they may expect to be considered for promotion. 2.d.4. Senior and/or junior officers may be adjusted before the convening date depending upon attrition or status changes. An officer's eligibility for consideration for promotion is determined as of the date the board convenes. If an officer's DOR is such that he or she will meet the minimum TIG by the convening date of the board, then the officer is advised to prepare for consideration and ensure ample time for review of their record. Information on preparing for a promotion board is available at the officer promotion homepage. 3. Board Correspondence and Preparation Guidance. Per references (c) and (d), promotion selection boards shall give consideration to any timely communication made to the board. Board Correspondence is considered timely if received NLT 10 calendar days before the board. This is a statutory requirement and cannot be waived. Late correspondence will not be accepted under any circumstances. Officers should review reference (a), the FY27 Board Schedule, for information on how to submit board correspondence, updating and auditing the Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) and Master Brief Sheet (MBS), fitness reports, deferment of eligibility, and requests for non-selection prior to the convening date of the board. Officers may also review reference (a) at the officer promotion homepage. 4. Deferment of eligibility. Marine Corps Officers who would be eligible for consideration by a promotion selection board (PSB) as an in-zone or above-zone eligible officer within one year of placement on the ADL shall be informed that their eligibility for such consideration will be deferred unless they specifically request consideration. The officer may waive this deferment and request consideration for promotion, in writing, as specified in the MARADMIN which announced the officer's eligibility. Requests must be received no later than the convening date of the board. The Deputy Commandant (DC), Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA) shall normally place such officers' records before the PSB. 5. Merit-Based Promotion List Reorder. Section 616(h) of Title 10, U.S. Code, allows the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) to authorize promotion boards to reorder recommended promotion lists based on particular merit. Officers on the Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel promotion list may be placed higher on the promotion list only if the officer receives the recommendation of at least a majority of the members of the board. 6. Continuation Boards. Upon conclusion of the lieutenant colonel and major promotion selection boards, the boards will reconvene as continuation boards as specified below. Officers may verify their eligibility for consideration by contacting Commandant Marine Corps (CMC), Manpower Management Separations and Retirement (MMSR). CMC (MMSR) will adjust the mandatory retirement dates and/or notify the officers selected for continuation, as applicable, after the promotion selection results have been announced. The following continuation boards will be convened: 6.a. FY27 USMC Major Continuation Board. 6.a.1. The board will consider regular unrestricted majors who, on the day prescribed for removal from active duty, possess less than 18 years of active service, who have twice failed selection for promotion to lieutenant colonel, who, as a result of not being selected for promotion, are subject to involuntary discharge, who are deemed by a majority of the members of the board to be fully qualified for continuation and whose continuation is in the best interests of the Marine Corps. The officers selected for continuation will be continued on active duty until retirement- eligible in accordance with (IAW) section 8323 of Title 10, U.S. Code or until the age of 62, whichever is earlier. 6.a.2. In addition, the board will select for continuation Regular Majors with a primary MOS of 0370, 3002; and across occupational fields (Occfields) 17XX, 73XX, and 75XX who are subject to involuntary discharge or retirement, this includes any officer previously continued, and are deemed by a majority of the members of the board to be fully qualified for continuation and whose continuation is in the best interests of the Marine Corps, who have mandatory retirement dates between 1 July 2027 and 31 December 2027. The period of continuation will be 5 years, 24 years of active commissioned service, or until the age of 62, whichever is earlier. 6.b. FY27 USMC Captain Continuation Board. 6.b.1. The board will consider captains who possess over 15 years of active service but less than 18 years of active service on the day prescribed for removal from active duty, who have twice failed selection for promotion to major, who, as a result of not being selected for promotion, are subject to involuntary discharge, and who are deemed by a majority of the members of the board to be fully qualified for continuation and whose continuation is in the best interests of the Marine Corps. The period of continuation will be for 5 years or until the officers are retirement eligible under section 8323 of Title 10, U.S. Code or until the age of 62, whichever is earlier. 6.b.2. In addition, the board will select for continuation for a period of 3 years, or until the age of 62, whichever is earlier, those captains in the primary MOS of 4402; and across Occfields 17XX, 73XX and 75XX who, on the date of mandatory discharge, will have less than 15 years of active commissioned service, including any officer previously continued who is deemed by a majority of the members of the board to be fully qualified for continuation and whose continuation is in the best interests of the Marine Corps. 7.

Under the provisions of section 578 of ref (a) and ref (c), the Secretary of the Navy, acting for the President of the United States, hereby authorizes the promotion of the following named regular officer(s) as indicated, to the permanent grade of Chief Warrant Officer Five (CWO5) through Chief Warrant Officer Three (CWO3). Rank, pay, and allowances are effective from 1 April 2025. Name Grade MCC Raymond M. GarciaCortijo CWO5 JF1 Stephen E. Tobin CWO5 070 Daniel J. Emick CWO4 013 Justin R. Genovese CWO4 15A Harry D. Goldsborough CWO4 013 Andrew Ridley CWO4 012 Justin E. Sweda CWO4 027 Joseph D. Carlisle CWO3 V15 Martin Sosa CWO3 1JZ 6. Delay of Promotion 6.a. Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (h), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected. This includes the physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section 10206 of ref (a). Ref (a) requires written notification to the officer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable. Commanding Officers must also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of administrative action. Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation. 6.b. Adverse Screening Process. Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or potentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10) removed the names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL). 7. Retirement and Transfer. Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion. An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component. 8. Accepting and Declining Promotion. Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 2 through 5 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted). To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade. Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline. 9.

MARFORRES will publish a monthly list of eligible Marines and provide this list to each Major Subordinate Command (MSC) AC/S G-1, and the Finance Offices. MARFORRES will add eligible SMCR Marines (via cross-org) to a restricted list into the Defense Travel System (DTS) that will be utilized to settle authorized IDT Travel Reimbursement claims utilizing the FY Lines of Accounting (LOA) that corresponds with the travel period. Any outstanding claims must be settled against these previous FY LOAs no later than 31 December, of the same calendar year. Example: FY25 LOA claims must be settled by 31 December 2025. b. IMA Operational Sponsors will coordinate with MARFORRES to add eligible IMA General Officers and board selected senior leader assignments to the IDT LOA. c.

Parent units will verify that their Marine meets the criteria set forth in paragraph 3, is on the eligibility roster for the month claimed or in receipt of a waiver from COMMARFORRES. Parent units are responsible for ensuring compliance with updates published by RA. e. MARFORRES is responsible for managing the LOAs and for confirming member eligibility based on RA criteria. f. RA will conduct an annual review and publish updates to eligibility requirements to ensure funds are used to incentivize Marines to fill critical manpower shortfalls. g.

To request tickets, a passenger reservation request form must be filled out. This form is available on the RA Career Management Team website under resources and is labeled IDT travel form. Completed forms are emailed to marforres@ciazumano.com and tickets are normally issued by next business day. 8. Reference (d) is hereby canceled. 9. Authorizations granted in this MARADMIN remain in place until canceled or updated by a future MARADMIN. 10. Reimbursement will continue at the discretion of RA or as otherwise mandated by law.

This is a HQMC PP&O (POP/POR/POF), HQMC I&L (LPM/LPO/LPS), TECOM (MAGTF-TC G-3, Policy and Standards Division), MCICOM (G-3/5), MARFOR Readiness and Exercise Offices, and MEF Readiness and Exercise Offices coordinated message. 2. Purpose. This MARADMIN provides interim guidance for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense (CBRND) readiness reporting specific to training, equipping, assessment/certification, per REF A through T. This MARADMIN cancels MARADMIN 135/23. 3. Background. In accordance with the references, units organize, train, equip, and certify, through exercise scenarios, to ensure forces can perform required mission essential tasks (MET) in CBRN environments. This provides properly trained Fleet Marine Forces (FMF) to combatant and joint force commanders' countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD) objectives. The metrics for CBRND training and equipment readiness have not kept pace with changes in data systems and strategy requirements. The interim guidance in this MARADMIN will collect objective unit and individual readiness data to inform policy changes. Commanders will report CBRND readiness using current interim guidance. 4. CBRND Training Factors. CBRND training is divided into five distinct factors listed in 4.A. through 4.E. Commanders will calculate their units' CBRND T-levels based on the factors and report the reason code from the table in 4.F. which best illustrates the limiting factor: 4.A. FACTOR ONE: CBRN Individual Training Standards (ITS). 4.A.1. Criteria. The 17 ITS are listed in REF D. ITS provide the essential skills personnel must master to survive a CBRN incident and will be conducted through classroom training, practical application, or field training, as appropriate. Units are encouraged to conduct training separate from the Individual Protective Equipment Confidence Exercise (IPECE). If a unit does not have organic CBRND personnel, commanders will coordinate training support through higher headquarters. Completion of ITS is recorded in MCTIMS with code CB-CBRND ITS. 4.A.2. Calculation: Number of on-hand personnel who have completed ITS in the last 12 months divided by total personnel on-hand equals percent of trained personnel. 4.B. FACTOR TWO: Individual Protective Equipment Confidence Exercise. 4.B.1. Criteria. Completion of an IPECE within the previous 12 months. Completion does not need to have been with the current unit. If a unit does not have organic CBRND personnel, commanders will coordinate training support through higher headquarters. Completion of IPECE is recorded in MCTIMS with code CA-CBRND IPECE. 4.B.2. Calculation: Number of deployable O/H strength who have completed the IPECE in the last 12 months divided by total deployable O/H strength equals IPECE completion percentage. 4.C. FACTOR THREE: CBRN Monitor Team (formerly CBRN Reconnaissance & Surveillance team) Training. 4.C.1. Criteria. The requirement in REF D Encl (1) Paragraph 3.c.(2)(b) is cancelled. CBRN monitor teams employ chemical and radiological detection equipment to inform the commanders decision making. Commanders will train two operators for each M-4 Joint Chemical Agent Detector (TAMCN: C2014) on the unit table of equipment. Commanders will provide team members initial and sustainment team training for all detection equipment on the unit's table of equipment (T/E) in accordance with REF D. Commanders may determine if additional CBRN monitor team members are required based on assigned missions. Assignment as team members and completion of initial training is recorded in MCTIMS with code CC-CBRND Monitoring & Surveillance (Initial). Sustainment training is recorded in MCTIMS with code CD-CBRND Monitoring & Surveillance (Quarterly). 4.C.2. Calculation: Number of monitor team members trained and current (quarterly sustainment completed) divided by monitor team members required equals percentage of trained monitor team members. 4.C.3. Directed Comments: Number of team members trained/number of team members required/percentage. (Example: CBRN monitor teams: 1/8/13%) 4.D. FACTOR FOUR: Decontamination Teams: 4.D.1. Criteria. The requirement in REF D Encl (1) Paragraph 3.c.(4)(b) is cancelled. Commanders will determine the number and composition of their decontamination teams based on tables of equipment, unit of employment and mission analysis. Initial and sustainment training will be completed in accordance with REF D. Marine aircraft squadron commanders are required to train personnel in aircraft decontamination IOT maintain readiness and regenerate sorties. Decontamination team members may also serve on monitor teams. Assignment as team members and completion of initial training is recorded in MCTIMS with code CE-CBRND Decontamination (Initial). Sustainment training is recorded in MCTIMS with code CF-CBRND Decontamination (Quarterly). 4.D.2. Calculation: Number of team members trained and current (quarterly sustainment completed) divided by team members required equals percent of team members trained. 4.D.3. Directed Comments: In the CBRN Overall comments box, enter the number of decontamination team members trained/number of team members required/percent. (Example: CBRN decon teams: 24/36/67%) 4.E. FACTOR FIVE: METs evaluated in a simulated CBRN environment. 4.E.1. Reference B requires commanders to assess their units' readiness to accomplish their missions in CBRN environments. This requires units to integrate relevant simulated CBRN environments into training and exercises. The baseline criteria for a simulated CBRN environment are planning for CBRN threats and reacting to CBRN incidents during a unit exercise. Scenarios will exercise units' staff planning processes and individual and collective techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTP) to protect the unit and sustain operations. Where practical, commanders will request and incorporate CBRN response augments into scenarios. 4.E.2. All Other Unit Types 4.E.2.A. Commanders will review their METL and identify which METs their units are realistically expected to execute in CBRN environments. 4.E.2.B. Commanders may request relief of MET training requirements from the first general officer in the chain of command or his delegate. If a waiver is granted, the commander will only assess CBRND readiness for the remaining METs. 4.E.2.C. Commanders must resubmit for relief of CBRND training requirements after 12-months. 4.E.2.D. Commanders relieved of all MET training requirements will not factor MET assessment into the unit T-level. Regardless of MET training requirements, commanders will still complete CBRND individual and team training. 4.E.2.E. Calculation: Number of METs assessed internally in a simulated CBRN environment as Qualified Yes (Q) or evaluated externally as Yes (Y) during an exercise (MCCRE, SLTE, CERTEX, ETC.) in the past 12 months divided by number of METs required to be trained for CBRN environments equals percent of CBRN capable METs. Commanders will not select T-1 unless all required METs are assessed as (Y) in a simulated CBRN environment. 4.E.2.F. Directed Comments. In the CBRN Overall comments box, commanders will list all METs, a Y/Q/N assessment of the unit's ability to accomplish the MET in a CBRN environment, and the date the MET was observed in a simulated CBRN environment. METs approved for CBRND training relief will be listed as N/A with the date of approval. (Example: MCT 1.6.1/Q/20221110 or MCT 4.5.7.3/N/A/20220501) 4.F. Determining CBRND T-level: After calculating the percentage for each of the required training factors, unit commanders will select the requirement with the lowest percentage and use the corresponding CBRND T-Rating reason code (read in 6 columns): FACTOR T-1 T-2 T-3 T-4 T-CODE ITS >=85% 70-84% 55-69% <55% TNA IPECE >=85% 70-84% 55-69% <55% TNF MONITOR TEAM >=85% 70-84% 55-69% <55% TNC DECON TEAM >=85% 70-84% 55-69% <55% TNC MET ASSESSMENT >=85% 70-84% 55-69% <55% TNB 4.F.1. When multiple factors contribute to a reduced T-rating, commanders shall select the reason code which best communicates the shortfall. 4.F.2. Reason Codes. This MARADMIN suspends the use of training codes TND, TNE, TNG, TNH, TNI, TNJ, TNL, TNN, TNO, and TNQ identified in REF I. An update will be submitted to the appropriate defense office by PP&O for applicable Marine Corps readiness reason codes identified in REF H. 4.G. Information related to CBRND training in REF H is still applicable. PP&O has identified the discrepancy in terminology identified in REF H (CBRNE) and will update this inaccuracy during the next review of this document. 5. CBRND Equipment: Unit commanders will track CBRND equipment IOT accomplish METs in a CBRN environment ISO MAGTF, CCMD, JFC assigned mission (including exercises). 5.A. General 5.A.1. Per REF (B), (J), and (K) CBRND equipment supports General Purpose Force (GPF) units, identified personnel aboard installations are issued prior to deployment, based upon increased intelligence indications and warnings of a CBRN threat. CBRND equipment prepositioned, either afloat or at ashore sites, is for sustainment of the MAGTF. 5.B. CBRND Equipping. Unit commanders retaining reportable CBRN equipment will calculate and report their unit's CBRND supply readiness (S-Level) as identified in REF B. 5.C. Unit Accountability/Responsibility. Per REF (M), immediately upon unit receipt, delivery, or acceptance of CBRND equipment, unit accountable officers, via their appointed supply officer/accountable property officer, will establish Marine Corps accountable property records and maintain them using information technology. The accountability of Marine Corps property throughout its lifecycle will not be compromised by virtue of its status (i.e., excess, obsolete or unserviceable) or physical location (e.g., in-transit, in theater, or loaned to a contractor). 5.D. Readiness Reporting. Per REF (B) and (J) all serialized CBRND equipment (excluding individual issued field protective mask) on-hand and identified on the unit's table of equipment (T/E) will be reported as principal end items (PEI), class II CBRND equipment, or consumables. PEI will be reported within the CBRND tab of DRRS by the unit S-4. If PEI, class II CBRND equipment, or consumable shelf-life issues / shortages occur while deployed or in possession of the equipment, units will utilize the best description reason code(s) identified within REF H to assist HQMC/MCSC/SE/JS/DOD in mitigating equipment shortfalls. Note: Equipment in excess of the unit's T/E may be issued as determined by unit analysis and MEF approval. As determined by higher headquarters, tasking in support of MAGTF, CCMD, or JFC operations / exercises, GPF units with attached CBRN Response capabilities required to carry out assigned missions will report CBRN response equipment as mission essential equipment (MEE) and identify this equipment as MEE on unit DRRS reports. 5.E. Information related to CBRND equipment in REF L is still applicable. PP&O has identified the discrepancy in terminology identified in REF L (CBRND-E & NBCDE) and will update this inaccuracy during the next review of this document. 5.F. Units assigned Marine Corps Task (MCT) 6.4 as a MET will not report CBRN response training or equipment in the CBRND tab of DRRS. These will be reported the same as all other METS in the core or assigned mission tabs. 6. CBRND Evaluation and Certification. The evaluation and certification of a unit's ability to conduct METs under simulated CBRN environment can be accomplished by identified events in paragraphs 6.A. or 6.B. of this MARADMIN. 6.A. Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation (MCCRE) 6.A.1. In accordance with REF F, GPF baseline CBRND training identified in section 4.C. of this MARADMIN will be assessed during a unit's MCCRE, which evaluates the effectiveness of the command's CBRND training and the unit's ability to execute related METs and respond to / recover from a CBRN event/hazard. This will ensure the unit's ability to support MAGTF operations/tasks and CCMD/JFC CWMD mission requirements. 6.A.2. Commanders will include CBRND personnel in the preparation and planning for upcoming MCCRE per REF F to ensure deliberate planning and inclusion of a realistic, intelligence modeled CBRN scenario, IOT evaluate the unit's proficiency to accomplish METs while operating in a CBRN environment. 6.A.3.

This MARADMIN announces the implementation and special enrollment period for the Health Care Federal Flexible Spending Account (HCFSA) Program for active-duty and active-reserve Marines. 2. Background. On 13 September 2024, Secretary of Defense Memorandum \"Our Enduring Duty to America's Service Members and Their Families\" directed the implementation of the HCFSA Program. 3. HCFSA Defined. HCFSA is an optional benefit that enables service members to use pretax earnings to pay for eligible health care expenses. Each service member can contribute between $100.00 to $3,300.00 per year to their account. Households with dual military couples can maintain two separate accounts and contribute a combined total of $6,600.00 per year. Service members must use and claim the funds in their HCFSA account by the end of the plan year. While you can carry over up to $660.00 of unused funds to the next year if you re-enroll in the HCFSA Program, any remaining funds will be forfeited. 4. Ineligible Expenses. HCFSA cannot be used to pay for health insurance, life insurance, long term care insurance or any other insurance premiums, or costs for temporary continuation of coverage (TCC). 5. Eligibility. To be eligible for enrollment in the HCFSA, Marines must be on active-duty or active-reserve with an expectation of being on active duty no less than six months of the effective calendar year. 6. Enrollment period. HCFSA will be available to service members for the first time through a special enrollment period from 3 March to 31 March 2025. Service members can enroll online through the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS)at https:(slash)(slash)www.fsafeds.com. 6.a. Upon enrollment, Marines can access the full amount of their HCFSA on day one of the plan year. Payroll deductions for the HCFSA contributions will be deducted in equal increments every pay period unless the member chooses to accelerate deductions. 6.b. It is extremely important for Marines to plan and budget accordingly when deciding to participate in the HCFSA. Marines must carefully consider their out-of-pocket medical, dental, and vision care expenses prior to electing to participate in the HCFSA Program. To obtain funds contributed into a HCFSA account, Marines will need to file a claim for reimbursement online through their FSAFEDS account. FSAFEDS will reimburse service members with available funds from their HCFSA based upon their elected reimbursement preference of either direct deposit or check. 7. Management. Marines can manage all aspects of their HCFSA through their FSAFEDS online account https:(slash)(slash) www.fsafeds.com or by downloading the FDAFEDs application to their personal mobile device. 8. Administration. Marines must re-enroll each year during open season to continue participation. Enrollment does not carry forward from year to year. 9. HCFSA Tools. To assist Commanders and Marines, several HCFSA tools can be found on the FSAFED website: https:(slash)(slash) www.fsafeds.com website. Marines can also contact their local installation personal financial manager (PFM) or call FSAFEDS directly toll free at 877-372-3337. Overseas participants can call toll free at +1 650-577-5294. 10. This MARADMIN is applicable to active duty and active reserve only. 11. Release authorized by Lieutenant General Michael J. Borgschulte, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//"

Rank, pay, and allowances are effective from the date indicated. Name DOR MCC Ian A. Buck 01Apr25 K79 Luke D. Joyce 29Apr25 KBM 4. Delay of Promotion 4.a. Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (g), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected. This includes the physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section 10206 of ref (a). Ref (a) requires written notification to the officer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable. Commanding Officers must also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of administrative action. Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation. 4.b. Adverse Screening Process. Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or potentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10) removed the names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL). 5. Retirement and Transfer. Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion. An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component. 6. Accepting and Declining Promotion. Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted). To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade. Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline. 7. For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-9705 or DSN 278-9705. Email inquiries may be submitted via the Officer Promotions homepage at www.Marines.mil. Email address is officerpromotions@usmc.mil. 8. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower Management Division.//"

DABRIO/CIV/UNIT: DC PR SDI WASHINGTON DC/TEL: 571-733-7737/ E-MAIL: CHERYL.A.DABRIO@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. This message updates reference (a) and is a collaborative effort between Deputy Commandants (DC) for Programs & Resources (P&R) and Installations & Logistics (I&L) with the purpose of enhancing the implementation of DAI CUEC 9, hereby referred to as SOD controls. To manage risk effectively, comply with control standards, and achieve its financial statement audit goals, the Marine Corps must ensure that users with DAI access only have the necessary permissions required to perform their job functions. 2. Effectively immediately, all commands at levels 1-4 in DAI must resolve all identified SOD conflicts by either removing conflicting responsibilities from users or obtaining waivers from the designated authority. 3. As part of continuing actions, Commands will be required to support requests for information arising from the monthly review of SOD reports (Application Access Controls Governor and the Transactions Controls Governor reports). As part of this review, the P&R Systems and Data Integration (SDI) Division and the I&L Logistics Compliance Branch (LPC) will coordinate with applicable Commands to remediate identified SOD incidents. 4. Removing Conflicts. L1-L4 Commands must assess users' current DAI responsibilities and compare them to job requirements. Any identified conflict or unnecessary responsibilities must be removed by coordinating with the P&R User Management (UMX) Section. 5. Waivers. Some commands lack the personnel to distribute responsibilities between users per SOD requirements. Therefore, the Marine Corps has a waiver process to balance operational needs against compliance with control standards. 6. The SDI Division and the LPC Branch identified and reviewed applicable SOD conflicts. They ranked each conflict using a comprehensive review that assessed four risk criteria (fraud, audit, operations, and personable identifiable information). The analysis resulted in the following five risk categories and waiver paths: 6.a. Minimal risk conflicts will be adjudicated via an enterprise-wide waiver, and thus Commands are not required to address them. 6.b. Low risk conflicts will be adjudicated via waivers signed by the first General Officer in the chain of command. 6.c. Medium risk conflicts will be adjudicated via HQMC waivers. The SDI Director will adjudicate waivers for Financial Management (FM) and Oracle and Time Labor (OTL) personnel. The LPC Branch Head will adjudicate waivers for Other Government personnel. 6.d. High risk conflicts will be adjudicated via HQMC waivers. The Assistant Deputy Commandant P&R (Resources) will adjudicate waivers for FM and OTL personnel. The Assistant Deputy Commandant I&L Logistics Division will adjudicate waivers for Other Government personnel. 6.e. Waivers will not be granted for zero-tolerance risk conflicts. 7. Waiver Instructions 7.a. The SOD matrix, the risk register, waiver templates, and additional resources are available at https://usmc.sharepoint-mil.us/ sites/DCPR_SDI/Risk_Compliance/ 7.a.1. The SOD matrix provides a summarized view of the identified restricted role combinations. 7.a.2. The risk register provides a detailed view of SOD conflicts and the risk designation. 7.a.3. The waiver templates document the authorization for users to maintain SOD conflicts. There is a waiver template for each identified low, medium, and high-risk SOD conflict. 7.b. When users request a new responsibility through the access management system (i.e., ARMS), the system will identify if the new responsibility causes an SOD conflict, which requires a waiver to proceed. Users must coordinate with their respective Command Information Owners (IO) to initiate and submit waivers. 7.c. Command IOs must complete and submit to the designated authority a waiver request for each SOD conflict identified. 7.c.1. For low-risk SOD conflict, Commands should leverage their internal processes to submit and approve waivers. 7.c.2. For medium and high-risk SOD conflict, Command IOs must submit waivers using the Tier 1 Helpdesk JIRA process. 7.d. Users must upload the approved waiver to their profile in the access management system. The P&R UMX Section will validate the waivers. 7.e. If the request for a waiver is denied, the conflicting responsibility will not be granted or if it had already been granted, it will be removed. 8. When implementing the waivers, the following apply: 8.a. HQMC will evaluate and qualify the risk each SOD conflict poses to the enterprise annually and may result in conflicts being assigned to a different risk category. 8.b. Waivers are subject to periodic reviews to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness. They may be revoked or modified if it is determined that the risk level has changed or if compliance issues are identified. 8.c. Waivers are not automatically granted and will be voided when personnel are reassigned. The Marine Corps reserves the right to remove user responsibilities as necessary. All users must adhere to any mitigating controls established to minimize associated risks. Regular reviews and audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. 8.d. All DAI users have a fiduciary responsibility inherent in their roles as stewards of government resources and must report SOD conflicts and responsibilities that are no longer required to their respective IOs. 9. For specific questions, contact the following POCs: 9.1. FM personnel: Mr. Robert Burnand and Ms. Shajuana Nicholson. 9.2. All Other Government personnel: Ms. Sheila Warren. 9.3. OTL: Ms. Jessica Lynard-Kongkiat and Ms. Cheryl Dabrio. 10. This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force. 11. Release authorized by Anna N. K.

This MARADMIN updates policy for Marine Corps Recruiters and Liaisons regarding Armed Forces Classification Test (AFCT) retesting and waiver requests. 2. Background. Per reference (a), prior policy restricted Recruiters and Liaisons to a single retest while assigned to recruiting duty, requiring Marine Corps Recruiting Command (MCRC) G-3 and Headquarters Marine Corps Test Control (MPA) approval. Retesting was prohibited within six months of reassignment, and waivers for early retests were not authorized. 3. General. Effective immediately, Recruiters and Liaisons will follow the same AFCT retest policy as the Fleet Marine Force per references (a) and (b). The following restrictions are rescinded: 3.a. The one-time retest limit while on recruiting duty. 3.b. Requirement for MCRC G-3 approval before MPA authorization. 3.c. Six-month waiting period after reassignment. 4. Retest Request Process 4.a. Standard Retest. Marines may test once every six months without a waiver but no more than twice per calendar year. All retests require a Command Authorization Letter (see 4a). 4.b. Waivered Retest. A waiver request to test before six months (but no sooner than 90 days) requires: 4.b.1. A letter from the first O-5 Commander in the Marine's chain of command (District Commanding Officer for Recruiters and Liaisons). 4.b.2. A certificate of completion from an approved preparatory course (see 4c). 4.b.3. MPA approval. 4.c. Exceptions. In cases beyond a Marine's control (e.g., MOS closure, deployment), the training certificate requirement is waived. 4.d. Restrictions. Waiver requests for tests before 90 days will not be considered. 5. Approved Preparatory Course Certificates for Waiver Requests: 5.a. DANTES: https:(slash)(slash)dantes.peterson.com 5.b. March2Success: https:(slash)(slash)www.march2success.com 6. Per reference (a), any courses or materials that directly train to the AFCT, including the FAST Army Test and Basic Skills Education Program, are prohibited. 7. In accordance with MCO 1230.5C (Classification Testing), Marines who compromise AFCT integrity will be reported to MPA and their command will conduct an investigation. Findings will be reviewed for adjudication by the District Commanding Officer with MCRC G-3 endorsement. 8. Submit requests or questions to MPA at SMB_manpower.msab.test@usmc.mil. 9. This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force. 10. Release authorized by Brigadier General David R.

This MARADMIN announces the establishment of Non- covered Assisted Reproductive Technology (NCART) and provides implementation guidance, including Permissive Temporary Additional Duty (PTAD) and authorized travel allowances, as directed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. NCART travel allowances are detailed in reference (b). Future revisions of references (c) and (d) will incorporate these changes. 2. Effective immediately, commanders should grant NCART PTAD or travel and transportation entitlements for NCART, as outlined in this MARADMIN. 3. Commanders remain responsible for meeting operational requirements while ensuring the health and safety of personnel under their care. Commanders will continue to display objectivity, compassion, and discretion when addressing healthcare matters. They are also responsible for enforcing existing policies regarding discrimination and retaliation in the context of reproductive technology. 4. Consistent with existing law and policy, commanders will protect the privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI) received under this MARADMIN. PHI will be restricted to personnel with a specific need-to-know for the conduct of official duties. Personnel are also accountable for safeguarding this information. 5. Only the following components of Assisted Reproductive Technology pertain to the policy and entitlements outlined in this MARADMIN: a. Ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval, including medications and procedures required for retrieval, processing, and utilization for ART or cryopreservation b. Sperm collection and processing for ART or cryopreservation c. Intrauterine insemination (IUI) d. In vitro fertilization (IVF) 6. NCART PTAD a. Eligibility. Active-duty Marines, including Reserve Marines on active-duty orders for 30 or more consecutive days, are eligible to receive NCART PTAD. Service members are also eligible to accompany a dependent or dual-military spouse receiving NCART without being charged leave. b. Duration and Documentation. NCART PTAD may not exceed 21 days per request and will be limited to the minimum number of days necessary to receive the required care and complete travel. The travel must be by the most expedient means practicable. Commanders will limit the health information required to verify eligibility and ensure authorized time meets these criteria. This may include, but is not limited to, a recommendation from the Unit Medical Officer (UMO) or a Department of Defense (DoD) Health Care Provider (HCP) confirming eligibility and the duration of the medical service or procedure. NCART PTAD is intended to maximize privacy protection for the Marine receiving the NCART service or procedure. c. Commander's Authority and Guidance. Commanders should grant NCART PTAD to Marines when a need for NCART is identified by the eligible Marine. Requests for NCART PTAD should be given full consideration and should be granted to the greatest extent practicable, unless the commander determines the Marine's absence would impair mission execution. This PTAD should be granted regardless of whether such care is available at the Marine's permanent duty station (PDS) or whether the dependent or dual- military spouse resides with or is geographically separated from the eligible Marine. (1) Commanders will act promptly and with appropriate discretion when considering requests for NCART PTAD. Delays in granting PTAD should not result in an eligible Marine being unable to access the NCART that served as the basis for the PTAD request. (2) Commanders will coordinate with Marines who anticipate recurring requests for NCART PTAD to balance operational requirements and healthcare schedules. Marines are expected to inform their command of planned recurring requests. (3) Commanders may grant convalescent leave, in accordance with reference (d), following an NCART service or procedure based on a recommendation from a DoD HCP or a non-DoD HCP providing care to the Marine. d. Limitations (1) Commanders or leave approving authorities will not levy additional requirements on the eligible Marine (including, but not limited to, consultations with a chaplain, medical testing, or counseling) before processing the NCART PTAD request. (2) NCART PTAD will not be granted to Marines who intend to sell, offer for sale, or receive proceeds from the sale resulting from an ART procedure while on, or in connection with, such absence. e. Marines are encouraged to meet with their UMO or DoD HCP to discuss potential work limitations following an NCART service/ procedure and to inform their command of these limitations to ensure proper planning for recovery. Commanders will not deny an NCART PTAD request based solely on these limitations. f. If a Marine or dependent decides against proceeding with NCART, the Marine will not have the time away charged as leave and will expeditiously return to their unit. 7. NCART Travel and Transportation Allowances a. Eligibility. Active-duty Marines and Reserve Component Marines on active-duty orders for 180 days or more, along with dependents of Marines, may be eligible for travel and transportation allowances when timely access to NCART is not available within the local area of the Marines PDS or Temporary Duty (TDY) location. Receiving care may be authorized when the NCART procedure is confirmed by documentation from the licensed health care provider or clinic performing the ART services. b. Eligible Marines and their dependents may choose their preferred medical facility for an NCART service or procedure. However, travel reimbursement is limited to the cost of reaching the closest available medical facility providing the NCART procedure. c. The command authorizing the travel is responsible for travel funding and must adhere to fiscal regulations. Travel cannot be approved without available funds. All leadership levels will support this policy and prioritize resource allocations accordingly. Commands facing funding concerns should collaborate with their chain of command and budget offices for assistance. d. If a Marine or their dependent decides against proceeding with the NCART service or procedure after travel has commenced, the Marine should expeditiously return to duty, and travel funds will not be recouped. 8. Administrative Requirements and Command Tracking Procedures a. Marines requesting NCART PTAD will use the Leave and Liberty module of Marine Online, selecting Type \"PTAD, Other\" and writing \"Non-covered Assisted Reproductive Technology\" in the comments section. b. Command Tracking. The Marine Corps is required to report the cost and usage of NCART PTAD and funded travel as authorized by references (a) and (d). Upon completion of NCART PTAD travel, commands will complete the NCART Tracker for all Service members and dependents, regardless of branch of service, by accessing the following Manpower and Reserves Affairs link via https:// www2.manpower.usmc.mil/tracker/. Select the \"Non-Covered Assisted Reproductive Technology\" tracker, then \"Create New\" and fill out the applicable information. No personally identifiable information (PII) will be entered into any report. To ensure maximum privacy protection, personnel with access to the tracker will only be able to view reports they submit on behalf of their command. 9. Release authorized by Brigadier General David R. Everly, Director, Manpower Plans and Policy Division.//"

The purpose of this MARADMIN is to announce the updated application submission process for the CY25-2 Enlisted to Officer (E-O) programs: Marine Corps Enlisted Commissioning Education Program (MECEP), Enlisted Commissioning Program (ECP), Enlisted to Judge Advocate Program (E-JA), Reserve Enlisted Commissioning Program (RECP), and Meritorious Commissioning Program-Reserve (MCP-R). 2. Boards and Selection. Per references (a) and (b), the E-O selection boards will convene: Board Application Deadline Board Convenes CY25-1 15 January 2025 15 April 2025 CY25-2 14 June 2025 14 October 2025 Selection board results will be published by a separate MARADMIN. Marines will be scheduled to the first available Officer Candidates Class (OCC). Deferment requests for scheduled OCC class will only be entertained for medical or personal hardships and approved on a case-by-case basis. Failure to attend scheduled class or disapproved deferments will result in disenrollment from the program. OCC report and graduation dates will be on the MCRC website. 3. Application and medical submissions. Complete applications must be submitted by the established deadline to be considered by the board. Requests to submit incomplete applications after the deadline will be disapproved. Marines must meet program and medical requirements in accordance with references (a), (b), and (f) at the time of application submission. Marines are required to use the E-O application on the MCRC website as it has changed from previous versions 3.a. Visit the MCRC website at www.mcrc.marines.mil. Select 'Marine Officer', then 'Naval and Enlisted Programs'. Click the Enlisted to Officer Commissioning tab. 3.b. Download the current Enlisted to Officer application. The current version is dated 20250227. Marines must also use the medical submission instructions on the website to ensure all medical requirements and timeframes are met. 3.c. Application must be in the same order as checklist to include required added documents. DO NOT include master brief sheets in application or documents not listed on checklist. Signed checklist must also be included with the application as the first page. Application and medical must be submitted as two separate PDF files. Both should be labeled as follows: EDIPI_Last Name Program App (1234567890_Marine MECEP App) EDIPI_Last Name Program Med (0987654321_Officer ECP Med) 3.d. The primary way for Marines to submit both their applications and medical is via the url: https:(slash slash)forms.osi.apps.mil/r/3bFx6VcBx4. The website can also be found by visiting: https: (slash slash)www.mcrc.marines.mil/Marine- Officer/Officer-Naval-Enlisted-Applicants/ and select the \"Enlisted to Officer Commissioning\" tab. Once on that webpage, scroll down to \"Application Submission\" to access the submission portal. Common Access Card (CAC) is required to access the application submission portal. 3.e. If the website is inaccessible, the secondary way for Marines to submit both their applications and medical is in DOD SAFE at www.safe.apps.mil to the OMB e_oboard@marines.usmc.mil. Both should be sent in one DOD Safe drop off as this system allows larger and multiple files to be sent at one time. Common Access Card (CAC) is required. DO NOT password protect the PDF files prior to uploading. Use the 'drop off option' and follow the directions to upload and submit. At a minimum, check both the \"encrypt every file\" and \"send me an email when each recipient picks up the file\" boxes on the right side. This allows Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to be sent and informs the sender when the application is picked up by the recipient. Encryption will require you to create a passphrase. Marines are directed to provide the passphrase separately to the OMB email and label the subject line \"DOD Safe passphrase\". DO NOT list any other information (EDIPI, PII, name) or punctuation within the passphrase email other than the passphrase as it initiates error emails stating PII has been detected. 3.f. In the event DOD SAFE will not accommodate your submission the tertiary option submit an application is by sending the application and medical files via unencrypted email to e_oboard@marines.usmc.mil. Attachments must not exceed a combined file size of 10MB to be accepted by the MCRC email server; this must be used as a very last option. The attachments must be password protected, and password must be included in the email. Password must be the same for both files. 3.g. DO NOT send submissions more than once. MCRC will provide confirmation of package receipt within 10 working days of the application deadline. 4. This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force. 5. The POCs for this MARADMIN are Capt Monique Devitt and Ms. Troi Spencer. Please refer to POC information at the beginning of this MARADMIN. For email correspondence, email organizational mailbox e_oboard@marines.usmc.mil. 6. Release authorized by Major General William J. Bowers, Commanding General, Marine Corps Recruiting Command.//"

Purpose. This MARADMIN provides interim guidance and announces upcoming policy changes regarding exceptions to policy (ETP) for uniform and grooming standards based on a medical condition. The strength of the Marine Corps has always been its people. Ensuring the health, resilience, and discipline of our Marines and Sailors is essential to sustaining our warfighting capability and maintaining the high standards required to remain ready for any challenge. These standards ensure we remain the world's premier fighting force, ready to fight and win with unwavering readiness, discipline, and lethality. 2. Background. All personnel authorized to wear the Marine Corps uniform must comply with Marine Corps uniform and grooming standards per reference (b). Medical conditions may necessitate temporary modifications. Examples include a Service member recovering from surgery requiring a brace or sling, a Service member diagnosed with Pseudofolliculitis Barbae (PFB) or other facial skin conditions/ wounds needing to temporarily refrain from clean-shaving, or an injured Service member requiring alternative footwear. 3. Immediate Action: 3.a. Military Medical Officers (MO): When a medical procedure or condition necessitates modifying a Service member's uniform or grooming standards, as defined by reference (b), the MO will provide a written waiver recommendation for the specific modification(s). 3.b. Commanding Officers (CO): COs will review the MO's recommendations and, in consultation with the MO, approve or disapprove the ETP. 3.c. Service members with approved ETPs: Affected personnel must retain and readily produce a copy of their approved ETP whenever deviating from the standards outlined in reference (b). This ETP may be presented in either hard copy or digital format. 4. Amplifying Information on PFB. 4.a. PFB is a medical condition that may require modified facial grooming, education, and treatment time. This interim guidance reaffirms existing treatment plans and clarifies commanders' responsibilities in supporting those protocols, with the ultimate goal of returning Service members to grooming standards and ensuring maximum warfighting readiness. 4.b. Interim Guidance for Facial Grooming Modifications: 4.b.1. PFB has a four-phase treatment approach outlined in detail in reference (c). During these phases, a MO may recommend modifying grooming standards and endorse the use of clippers. The following is a summary of each phase: 4.b.1.a. Phase I, Control of mild cases: Avoid shaving for up to 4 weeks until all lesions have subsided while undergoing medical treatment. 4.b.1.b. Phase II, Control of moderate to severe cases or those cases unresponsive to Phase I: Avoid shaving for up to 8 weeks if initially starting Phase II or up to an additional 4 weeks if continuing from Phase I, with hair removal by depilatory treatment according to treatment plan. 4.b.1.c. Phase III, Cases Unresponsive to Phase II Treatment: Continue Phase II protocols for up to an additional 4 weeks; the MO may then recommend continued treatment based on the patient's response and, if necessary, a further period of modified grooming standards. 4.b.1.d. Phase IV (Optional), Control of cases unresponsive to Phase III or recurring frequently: Referral to dermatology for possible laser treatment. This treatment is government-funded, but a Service member is not required to undergo laser treatment. 4.b.2. Medical Evaluations: As with other medical conditions requiring modified uniform and or grooming standards, MOs will recommend, and COs will approve or disapprove the modification. This change replaces the previous guidance in reference (a). 4.b.3. Documentation: When modified facial grooming standards are authorized, NAVMC 11830(02-25) will be used to document the ETP. The new NAVMC aims to improve communication between the member, medical providers, and command teams throughout the four-phase treatment plan. 4.b.4. Command Monitoring: COs with Service members diagnosed with PFB must actively monitor the four-phase treatment plan, as outlined in reference (c), to assist the Service member in returning to compliance as defined in reference (b). 5. Administration. 5.a. NAVMC Form 11830 (02-25). This form is not yet available through standard channel at forms.documentservices.dla.mil. In the interim, download the draft form from the Manpower & Reserve Affairs, Manpower Plans & Policy Division, Manpower Military Policy Branch (MPO) website at https:(slash)(slash) www.manpower.marines.mil/Plans-and-Policies/Manpower-Plans-and- Policy/Manpower-Military-Policy-MPO/Uniform-Grooming-Mods-Related -to-Medical-Conditions/. 5.b. Administrative Separation. Marines needing a uniform or grooming ETP based on a medical condition for over one year may be considered for administrative separation due to incompatibility with Service. 6. Coordinating Instructions: 6.a. Within 90 days of this MARADMIN's release, all Service members with a current PFB diagnosis must be re-evaluated by a Medical Officer. Re-evaluation will assess the Service member's current treatment protocol and determine the need for further treatment. If the MO determines that the Service member's condition warrants an ETP, the MO will use the revised NAVMC to facilitate communication between the Service member, medical, and COs. 6.b. Effective immediately, this MARADMIN supersedes reference (a) and aligns the treatment of PFB with all other medical conditions impacting modifications to uniform and/or grooming standards. 7. The changes in this MARADMIN will be incorporated into a forthcoming Marine Corps Order. 8. This message applies to the Marine Corps Total Force. 9. Release authorized by Brigadier General David R. Everly, Director, Manpower Plans and Policy Division.//"

This message solicits applications for the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Lateral Move (LatMove) Panel for 1706 and 1707 (17XX) Primary Military Occupational Specialties (PMOS) in accordance with the references and guidance contained herein. Major timeline milestones are: Date Milestone 25 May 2025 Applications due 9 June 2025 FY26 17XX LatMove Panel Convenes 2. The FY26 17XX LatMove Panel will consider Active Component (AC) unrestricted officers as eligible to apply for lateral move into the PMOSs listed below (read in two columns): PMOS Title 1706 Maritime Space Officer 1707 Influence Officer 3. Eligibility requirements 3.a. Unrestricted officers in the grades of captain (to include captain-selects) through lieutenant colonel. 3.a.1. Captains and captain-selects will only be considered if they are career designated or scheduled to screen for career designation on the FY25 Career Designation Panel (CDP) 2. 3.a.2. Eligibility criteria and timelines for FY25 CDP 2 will be provided on a forthcoming message. 3.b. Officers selected for 17XX LatMove will be ineligible to screen on the FY26 O-5 Command Screening Board. 3.c. Officers in joint billets are eligible if they have completed 24 months in their assignment by 1 June 2026. 3.d. Officers in Commandant's Education Board utilization tours are eligible if they have completed 36 months of their utilization tour by October 2026. 3.e. Officers in the above zone for promotion are not eligible. 3.f. Officers must meet their prescribed tour control factor (TCF) by 1 June 2026. If an applicant does not meet their prescribed TCF requirements, they must submit an exception to policy (ETP), endorsed by the first O-6 in the chain of command, via NAVMC 10274 (AA-Form), with their application. Transfer inside of the prescribed TCF will result in a gap for that command until the TCF has concluded. If an officer is selected prior to his/her normal rotation date, Manpower Management Officer Assignments (MMOA) Branch will attempt to provide a backfill. A commander's endorsement of the AA Form is considered acknowledgement of this situation. MMOA will adjudicate the ETP separately from the panel process and must be approved by MMOA before a Marine will be considered for a 17XX LatMove. An officer with an approved ETP will be a FY26 mover regardless of selection to 17XX LatMove. 3.g. All unrestricted officers are eligible to apply to the LatMove Panel; however, current and forecasted inventory levels by PMOS and grade will be considered during the selection process. 3.h. The criteria listed above are matters of Service policy. Exceptions to the above-listed criteria will be considered on a case-by-case basis and approved at the discretion of Director, Manpower Management Division. 4. Service Obligation 4.a. Officers approved for LatMove to the 1706 or 1707 PMOS will incur a service obligation upon completion of PMOS school and awarding of the PMOS designator. 4.b. Applicants who require fewer than four weeks of training for the requested PMOS will incur a 36-month Active-Duty service obligation upon awarding of the new PMOS. Applicants who require greater than four weeks of training for the requested PMOS will incur a 60-month Active-Duty service obligation upon awarding of the new PMOS. 5. Officers who do not complete the required PMOS school will be reassigned to the PMOS held at time of application or at the discretion of MMOA. 6. Application Procedures 6.a. LatMove applications must be submitted via AA Form. Applications must be endorsed by the first O-6 in the applicant's chain of command as appropriate. Refer to the MMOA-3 Manpower Website https://www.manpower.marines.mil/Manpower-Management/ Officer-Assignments/#tab/retention-and-release for package templates. 6.b. All LatMove applications will include the following: 6.b.1. At least one but not more than three letters of recommendation attesting to the applicant's leadership, technical skills and abilities, and overall performance. 6.b.2. A one- to two-page personal statement in naval letter format explaining why the officer desires to LatMove into the requested PMOS. The applicant will reference any unique experiences relevant to the gaining PMOS. Applicants will distinguish between training, education, and operational experience. 6.b.3. A letter of sensitive compartmented information (SCI) eligibility from the HQMC Special Security Officer (SSO) (hqmc_intel_sso@usmc.mil). A letter from their local SSO is not sufficient. 6.b.4. Applicant's unofficial transcripts for all undergraduate and graduate education. 6.b.5. E-mail correspondence from the applicant's PMOS monitor providing recommendation on LatMove and verification that member will complete their TCF per paragraph 3.f. 6.b.6. OMPF update material. Officers should submit OMPF update requests via OMPF-Records Management Application (O-RMA). If assistance is required, contact your unit S-1 or local IPAC.

The deadline for application submission is 2359 Eastern Daylight Time 25 May 2025. Applications received after this date will not be considered. 7. All applications must be addressed to CMC (MMOA-3) and submitted as a single portable document file (PDF) file to the MMOA-3 Organizational Mailbox at SMBMANPOWEROFFICERPR@USMC.MIL and labeled as \"EDIPI_LastName_1706\" or \"EDIPI_LastName_1707\", depending on the requested MOS. Each file cannot be larger than 800 KB. Failure to do so will result in the LatMove application being returned with no action taken. All submissions will receive a receipt notification. Officers selected for LatMove will execute orders to the next available PMOS school or as directed by MMOA. 8. Officers that are approved for LatMove will be expected to attend required PMOS training and proceed to their future units as soon as available or as directed by MMOA. Requests to delay or defer training or assignment outside of the yearly cycle will not be approved. 9. Per reference (a), all LatMoves are strictly voluntary. Marines who do not wish to LatMove into the 17XX Occupational Field (OccFld) but are currently serving in 05XX BMOS billets that are transitioning to a 17XX BMOS may continue to serve out their current assignment in that billet. 10. Officers executing LatMove and follow-on training prior to permanent change of station should be considered \"non available\" by current RS/RO and should not be graded down because of this. 11. Upon promotion to colonel, officers in the 17XX PMOS will merge into the 8041 population. 12. All officers interested in this LatMove opportunity are encouraged to join the 17XX OccFld Information Microsoft TEAMS page at https:(slash)(slash)go.intelink.gov/xTL9YA4. 13.

Situation. This message signals the culmination of initiatives to establish a USMC program of record for Service level enterprise-wide Force Management, establishing the means to support data-driven resourcing decisions through the automation and organization of massive amounts of critical data required to organize and employ forces. Mobile Training Teams (MTT) will be formed to support the first of a phased system release in the fall of 2025. 1.a. Force Management Tool (FMT) and Slider applications will sunset and be replaced with the Strategic Management Decision Support (SMDS) module--Global Synchronization Analysis Management Planning System (GSAMPS) for utilization during the October 2025 Force Synchronization Forum. 1.b. Future, iterative system releases will begin in late 2025/early 2026 to include personnel data and enhanced analytic support; separate message traffic will address the detailed system fielding plan, virtual training guides, Marine Net and additional MTT feasibility support. 1.c. Decisions to further develop joint interfaces, integrated reserve activation data, among other initiatives are pending. 2. Mission. Inform stakeholders of SMDS (GSAMPS) capability, statutory foundation, strategic baseline and plan to implement MTTs during the August through September 2025 timeframe, for select G-S3/G-S5/G-7 users at MEFs and MARFORS. 2.a. Capability 2.a.1. SMDS (GSAMPS) will serve as a \"live\" Global Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP), enabling MARFORs and MEFs to register, source and track changes to supporting Combatant Commander (CCDR) operational, exercise and training requirements, in addition to Service directed activities and training. 2.a.2. System capabilities will be released in a phased approach, first integrating data from authoritative legacy structure, manpower and readiness systems, aligned to CCDR and Service demand for capabilities. 2.a.3. SMDS (GSAMPS) will bridge the gap between USMC Title Ten forces offering, force/institutional risk assessment decisions and JS/OSD perspectives of USMC force availability-by providing a system to enable: 2.a.3.a. Force providers to align duty status of deployable populations during sourcing solution/risk to force development as requirements contract and expand, or combat losses impact force generation. 2.a.3.b. Service Headquarters to assess small to large scale total force impacts, particularly as modernization efforts affect sustainment, combat losses impact force generation and changes to mobilization authorities. 2.b. Statutory Foundation 2.b.1. Ref a directed the development of a Joint Force Activities Dataset (JFAD). JFAD links Global Force Management (GFM) employment/deployment data to planning activities in the Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM) database, enabling Service deployment data to be accessed for studies supporting the development and implementation of defense strategy and DoD PPBE activities. 2.b.2. Ref b identified the Service imperative to develop a strategic management tool, automating data feeds and analytic capabilities to provide holistic visibility and near real-time situational awareness to organize and comprehend massive amounts of critical data, across the enterprise, needed to inform senior leader decisions. 2.b.3. Ref c established public law requiring the Secretary of Defense to direct the development and implementation of a plan to strengthen analytic capabilities, specifically informing decision-making capabilities necessary to implement the National Defense Strategy. 2.b.4. Refs d-f set conditions to develop and implement a USMC program of record to serve as a tool to complement changes to GFM, force modernization and inform Senior Leaders decisions. 2.c. Strategic Baseline 2.c.1. Automates and improves GFM data accuracy, integrating data from legacy systems and enhancing Institutional Readiness Working Group (IRWG) initiatives to determine readiness impacts resulting from changes to operational demand, force capacity and force modernization. 2.c.2. Establishes the ability to resolve registered capability gaps to synchronize manpower resourcing impacts (analysis of PERSTEMPO, etc.) with GFM operational requirements, expands visibility of data to confirm risk and/or planning assumptions linking current operations with future force development/design initiatives supporting the Marine Corps Force Integration concept. 2.c.3. Enables visibility of data to support planning horizons between institutional, operational and tactical levels to modernize capabilities while forces are mobilized and/or employed. 2.c.4. Integrates visibility of T/E structure, DRRS equipment readiness data and operational requirements in a single system. 2.d. MTT and Follow-On Training Requirements 2.d.1. MTTs will establish a \"train the trainer\" program as the initial effort for key stakeholders to sustain sourcing submissions in support of the October 2025 Force Synchronization Conference. 2.d.2. MTTs will focus on building train the trainer cadre, while user guides and Marine Net training will be available to all. Future phased systems release in late 2025/early 2026-separate message traffic will address training support for capability updates. 3. Execution 3.a. Commanders intent. To identify MARFORCOM, II MEF, MARFORPAC, I MEF, III MEF and MARFORRES personnel responsible for establishing a training program to sustain sourcing related to GFM tasks. 4. Concept of operations. PP&O will form a MTT to support (5) \"train the trainer\" sessions. Each command will be required to provide space and SIPR computers to support designated parent command trainers and MTT personnel for a 3-day period within the August through September 2025 timeframe. 4.a. Training execution 4.a.1. MARFORCOM, Norfolk, VA 4.a.1.a. Requires proposed 3-day training period during August through September 2025. 4.a.2. II MEF, Jacksonville, NC 4.a.2.a. Requires proposed 3-day training period during August through September 2025. 4.a.3. MARFORPAC/III MEF, Oahu, HI 4.a.3.a.

In accordance with (IAW) the references, this message identifies initial billet assignments for Reserve First Sergeants (1stSgts) selected on the FY25 Selected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR) First Sergeant Special Promotion Selection Board. This message identifies newly selected 1stSgts approved for an initial 36-month tour. Per references, promotion allocations were based on actual and projected Billet Identification Codes (BIC) vacancies. Failure to accept assignment to a specified billet will result in revocation of selection to 1stSgt and involuntary transfer to the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). 2. 1stSgt selectees will be frocked IAW references (a), (e) and (f). Frocking is deemed in the best interest of the Marine Corps and approved with the understanding that frocked 1stSgts may assume the title and wear the uniform and rank of 1stSgt respectively, in the Marine Corps Reserve, and that no pay, allowances, or entitlements will take effect until the actual date of promotion. This message is the source document to frock selectees prior to detachment from their current unit. Frocking will occur no earlier than 60 days prior to the report date to the new unit (unless otherwise approved by the Director, Reserve Affairs (Dir, RA)). Requests for approval of an adjusted frocking date must be communicated to Reserve Affairs (RA SgtMaj) via the chain of command utilizing a NAVMC 10274 (AA form). Units will ensure a copy of this message is placed into the Marine's OMPF until the actual date of promotion. 3. Assignments of newly selected 1stSgts are for 36 months. However, tours may be adjusted based on the needs of the Marine Corps. Upon receipt of this message, Marines are directed to begin transfer coordination and prepare an inter-unit transfer (IUT) request in the Requirements Transition and Manpower Management System (RTAMMS) for RA approval. This message serves as the authority to approve the IUT request of the newly selected Marine to the approved Reporting Unit Code (RUC). In no case shall commanders recommend the transfer of any 1stSgt to any other billet than those listed below without prior written approval from the Dir, RA. The IUT request must be submitted in advance to allow timely processing by RA and to prevent issues with Inactive Duty Training (IDT) Travel Reimbursement. 4. Once the IUT is approved by RA in RTAMMS and upon joining the gaining command, the assignment of the 1stSgt BIC will be administered via RTAMMS. Selected Marines must be joined to their newly directed RUC to be placed in the HQMC RA directed BIC. Only a 1stSgt may fill a respective 8999 BIC per reference (h). The outgoing Marine is required to be placed into EX009 per reference (h). If eligible, both the outgoing and incoming 1stSgt will remain eligible for IDT Travel Reimbursement, not to exceed a turnover period of 90 days. The unit will contact Marine Forces Reserve, G-1 Manpower at SMB_IDT_TRAVEL@USMC.MIL to obtain an IDT Travel Reimbursement Waiver for the Marine in excess not to exceed that 90 day period. If the outgoing 1stSgt is pending retirement, this Marine will be reassigned as EX009 pending release to the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) awaiting final retirement. No later than 90 days from the day the SgtMaj or 1stSgt has reported, they will be administratively transferred to the IRR, unless prior coordination is made with the RA SgtMaj. 5. The report date for all 1stSgts is no earlier than the 1st of the month and no later than the last day of the month as listed below. Adjustments to report dates may be granted with prior coordination with the RA SgtMaj. In all cases, Marines will contact the gaining unit's administrative section and leadership to schedule an exact report date and ensure proper turnover procedures are completed. 6. The following selected 1stSgts are assigned a 36-month initial tour at the below listed units. Read in three columns: Name Unit/Location ET/NLT Paladino, R. P.

Routine healthcare will be reimbursed via the Tricare Overseas program. Non-emergency travel to U.S. military treatment facilities will not be authorized at government expense. 6.a.1. PEP personnel may qualify for special allowances which will meet many of the costs associated with independent, international duty. These may include cost of living allowance, temporary lodging allowance, and overseas housing allowance. These allowances may not cover all costs in all situations. All prospective PEP personnel must be financially stable and prepared to incur potential unexpected costs. 6.a.2. For PEPs serving with foreign partner nations, all pay and allowances (except travel expenses incurred on behalf of the host nation) will be paid by the USMC. PEPs will not receive host nation allowance or special pay. 6.a.3. Upon successful completion of PEP billet, PEPs will be assigned the Foreign Area Officer (FAO) or Regional Affairs Officer (RAO) additional MOS (AMOS) for their respective region. The assignment of this MOS may make PEPs eligible for potential utilization in a FAO or RAO billet in the future. PEPs with this AMOS may consult with their PMOS monitor if they desire to serve in a FAO or RAO billet in the future. 7. This MARADMIN is not applicable to the Marine Corps Reserve. 8. This MARADMIN is cancelled 1 Oct 2025. 9. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower Management Division.//"

This MARADMIN announces the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R)) authorization to extend the Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) timeframe in the Continental United States (CONUS) from 14 to 21 days, effective 27 November 2024. 2. Authorization. Per references (a) and (b), Marines executing Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders to a CONUS Permanent Duty Station (PDS), or reporting to their first CONUS PDS from their home of record or initial technical school, are authorized up to 21 days of TLE. 3. Eligibility. TLE partially reimburses Marines for temporary lodging and meal costs incurred by the Marine or their dependents while residing in temporary lodging within CONUS. This applies when staying in the vicinity of the old or new PDS, home of record, initial technical school, or a designated place during a PCS move. 4. Reimbursement Limits. The maximum daily TLE reimbursement rate is $290. Reimbursement is based on the locality per diem rate, the number and ages of dependents, and the actual lodging expenses incurred by the Marine or dependents, at the PDS, designated place, home of record, or initial technical school. Prior to occupying commercial lodging, Marines must use available Government quarters, as outlined in reference (b). However, this requirement does not apply to designated places. For example, a Marine on an unaccompanied or dependent restricted tour Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) may elect to leave their dependents at a CONUS location of their choosing\u2014a designated place. In this example, the Marine is not required to use Government quarters when claiming TLE at the designated place, however, they must use Government quarters when claiming TLE at the new PDS, if available. 5. TLE claim examples: 5.a. A Marine conducts a PCS between two CONUS PDSs. The Marine occupies temporary quarters at the new PDS from 1-21 April, claiming those dates for TLE. Their spouse and child remain at the old PDS, occupying temporary quarters from 22 April to 12 May, for which the Marine also claims TLE. The Marine certifies that Government quarters were unavailable at both locations. While the Marine can claim per diem for both locations during these periods, they will only be reimbursed for a maximum of 21 total days of TLE at a rate of $290 per day (a maximum of $6,090). If a Service member's claimed expenses exceed their authorized TLE reimbursement, they will be responsible for the difference. 5.b. Two Service members married to each other with two children relocate on PCS orders between two CONUS PDSs. Each Service member is authorized a maximum of 21 days of TLE, limited to $290 per day, (a maximum of $6,090 for each service member). Both Service members, with their dependents, occupy temporary quarters before and after reporting to the new PDS. After certifying that Government quarters were unavailable, each Service member may independently claim TLE for a period of up to 21 days. These 21-day periods may not overlap. For example: Service member (1) claims TLE for themselves and the two children from 1-21 April. Service member (2) claims TLE for themselves and the two children from 22 April - 12 May. If a Service member's claimed expenses exceed their authorized TLE reimbursement, they will be responsible for the difference. 5.c. Additional TLE examples can be at https://www.travel.dod.mil /Portals/119/Documents/JTR/CE/CE-MPDT-17.pdf. 6. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), can be found at https:// www.travel.dod.mil/Support/ALL-FAQs/Article/3174593/temporary- lodging-expenses/. 7. This MARADMIN is applicable to Marines/Sailors in an active duty status. 8. Release authorized by Lieutenant General Michael J. Borgschulte, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//"

This Marine administrative message (MARADMIN) announces the FY27 U.S. Marine Corps Officer Promotion Selection Board schedule and provides promotion guidance. See paragraph 14 for addresses, points of contact, and internet information mentioned in this MARADMIN. The FY27 U.S. Marine Corps officer promotion selection boards to recommend both active and reserve component officers for promotion will convene as follows: Selection To Component Bd.Corr.Due* Convening Date MajGen Active 27 Jun 25 8 Jul 25 MajGen Reserve 28 Jun 25 9 Jul 25 BGen Active 4 Jul 25 15 Jul 25 BGen Reserve 11 Jul 25 22 Jul 25 Col Active 20 Apr 25 1 May 25 Col Reserve 25 Jul 25 5 Aug 25 LtCol Active 25 Apr 25 6 May 25 LtCol Reserve 10 Jan 26 21 Jan 26 Maj Active 23 May 25 3 Jun 25 Maj Reserve 26 Dec 25 6 Jan 26 Col, LtCol, and Maj AR 25 Jul 25 5 Aug 25 LtCol and Maj LDO Active 30 Aug 25 10 Sep 25 Capt** Active 23 Jan 26 3 Feb 26 Capt** Reserve/AR 7 Feb 26 18 Feb 26 CWO Reserve/AR 7 Feb 26 18 Feb 26 CWO Active 31 Jul 26 11 Aug 26 *See paragraph 8 below for additional information on submitting Board Correspondence. Pursuant to Title 10, U.S.C. Section 614(b) or 14106, eligible officers are personally responsible for ensuring CMC (MMPB-10) has received their personal correspondence to the President of the Board NLT 2359 Eastern Standard Time (EST), 10 calendar days prior to the board convene date of their respective board to be considered. This is a statutory requirement and cannot be waived. Late correspondence will not be accepted under any circumstances. See paragraph 8 below for instructions on how to submit. ** For promotion to the grade of captain, a promotion selection board will not be convened. Instead, eligible officers will undergo an All-Fully-Qualified-Officers List (AFQOL) process. The official military records of all officers eligible for promotion to captain will be screened to identify those officers fully qualified for promotion to captain. Those officers determined not fully qualified for promotion will be omitted from the AFQOL and incur a failure of selection (FOS). The provisions set forth in this MARADMIN are applicable to AFQOL process, to include reviewing and preparing records for promotion consideration and submission of correspondence. 2. MARADMINs announcing the established dates of rank (DOR) for the promotion zones will be published approximately 30 to 60 days prior to each scheduled board. Upon announcement, officers may determine their eligibility status by reviewing references (a) and (b). Reference (a) provides a lineal list of all officers in the Marine Corps and reference (b) discusses eligibility. Officers with questions regarding their eligibility for a board or their status in reference (a) should contact the lineal staff, Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC), Manpower Management Performance Branch, Officer Promotion Unit (MMPB-10). Unless otherwise noted in the convening message, all officer promotion boards will take place at 2008 Elliot Road, Quantico, VA 22134. 3. Continuation selection boards. The convening of continuation selection boards will be announced in the MARADMIN announcing the promotion zones, as applicable, based on SECNAV-approved continuation plans for this fiscal year. Officers are advised that continuation boards are convened based on the needs of the Marine Corps and selection criteria may vary from year to year. 4. Eligibility for consideration for promotion. Time-in-grade (TIG) and other requirements. 4.a. Officers may not be considered for promotion to the next higher grade in any zone until the officers complete the minimum TIG as specified below. The minimum TIG may be waived based on the needs of the Marine Corps, except in the case of chief warrant officers (CWO). Grade Considered For Selection To TIG Brigadier General Major General 1 year Colonel Brigadier General 1 year Lieutenant Colonel Colonel 3 years Major Lieutenant Colonel 3 years Captain Major 3 years First Lieutenant Captain no minimum CWO 2, 3, 4 CWO 3, 4, 5 2 years There is no time in grade requirement for First Lieutenants to be considered for promotions. However, First Lieutenants must attain 2 years time in grade before promotion to Captain. This information provides officers with an approximate indication of when they may expect to be considered for promotion. An officer's eligibility for consideration for promotion is determined as of the date the board convenes. If an officer's DOR is such that he or she will meet the minimum TIG by the convening date of the board, then the officer is advised to prepare for consideration and ensure ample time for review of their record. Information on preparing for a promotion board is available at the officer promotion homepage. 4.b. Retirement and Separation. With the exception of the USMC Captain AFQOL, the Marine Corps will also request authority from SECNAV to preclude from consideration officers with an established separation date that is within 90 days after the date the board convenes. 4.c. One-year rule for Reserve Officers. Reserve officers are eligible for consideration for promotion if, on the date the board convenes, the officers have continuously performed service on either the RASL or the active-duty list (ADL) (or a combination of both lists) for one year. Service on the RASL includes service in the Ready Reserve (AR, SMCR, IMA, and IRR) and in an active status of the Standby Reserve. 4.d. U.S. Citizenship. An officer on the ADL in the grade of Captain who is not a U.S. citizen may not be considered for promotion to the grade of Major. 5. Deferment of eligibility. Marine Corps Officers who would be eligible for consideration by a promotion selection board (PSB) as an in-zone or above-zone eligible officer within one year of placement on the ADL shall be informed that their eligibility for such consideration will be deferred unless they specifically request consideration. The officer may waive this deferment and request consideration for promotion, in writing, as specified in the MARADMIN which announced the officer's eligibility. Requests must be received no later than the convening date of the board. The Deputy Commandant (DC), Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA) shall normally place such officers' records before the PSB. 6. Opt out of Consideration. See reference (c) for instructions and deadlines on submission of opt-out requests. 7. Personal responsibilities. Each officer is personally responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of their Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) and Master Brief Sheet (MBS) before the date the board convenes. The most expeditious means of obtaining and viewing the OMPF and MBS is through the OMPF-Record Management Application (O-RMA). Refer to reference (d) to determine what documents are appropriate for inclusion in the OMPF. Officers should verify any additions or deletions from their OMPF or MBS within the 12-month window to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their record. 7.a. OMPF document submission timelines. With the exception of fitness reports, all OMPF documents, should be forwarded to and received by CMC (MMPB-22) two weeks prior to the convening date of the selection board in order to allow processing time to the OMPF. Board eligible records continue to be updated until the convening date of the board, however, officers must submit all material no later than two weeks prior to the board for which they are eligible. 7.b. Career Counselors. Active-duty officers may conduct a self- audit of personal records via the self-audit document guide or through the link at the Marine Online/myOMPF/about OMPF tab. Career counseling for officers is now done by Officer Assignments (MMOA). Reserve officers may contact Reserve Affairs, Career Management Team (CMT), who will provide OMPF review and career counseling for all members of the Reserve Component (AR, SMCR, IMA, IRR). To request counseling services, e-mail to smb_manpower_cac@usmc.mil with your name, EDIPI, contact information, and the service you are requesting. More information can be found by accessing their website at \"www.manpower.usmc.mil/webcenter/portal/CMT/pages_home.\" 7.c. Fitness reports. Fitness reports are due to CMC (MMPB-23) by the timelines noted in reference (e). Reports mailed directly to the President of the Board will not be added to a Marine's OMPF. For fitness reports to become part of the OMPF, the reports must be submitted to CMC (MMPB-23). The automated performance evaluation system (A-PES) is the primary means of submitting fitness reports, however, reporting officials may email PDF copies to the MMPB-2 organizational mailbox at hqmc.fitrep.processing@usmc.mil, so long as the mailer's email account can be confirmed as either the reporting senior's or reviewing officer's .mil email address. If mailing a paper version of a report to HQMC, it is imperative that the forwarding envelope is conspicuously marked \"contains FITREPs for FY27 (appropriate board) selection board.\" Timely submission of fitness reports is critical for board eligible members as CMC (MMPB-23) will need time to review reports for accuracy and compliance. Commanders are ultimately responsible for the timely submission of fitness reports to CMC (MMPB-23) and ensuring all fitness report timelines noted in reference (e) are adhered to. 7.c.1. Date gaps must be corrected IAW chapter 8 and appendix F of reference (e). If missing reports are less than one year old, a reconstructed original is required. Copies of the completed fitness reports over one year old must have all pages certified as true copies by either reporting officials (RS/RO). For completion and submission of reports over one year old, it is preferable that the original reviewing officer complete the report, however, CMC (MMPB-23) may act as the reviewing officer on reports that are not adverse on a case by case basis. 7.c.2. Marines are reminded that requests for administrative changes to their fitness report records may take up to 30 days to complete. Reasonable diligence for records correction timeliness rests solely on the Marine making the request. 7.d. Professional Military Education (PME). The selection guidance (precepts) for many boards includes a reminder of the importance of PME, whether resident or non-resident, in an officer's development. Officers are advised to ensure that course completion information is noted on their MBS and that PME completion certificates are included in their OMPF to illustrate completion. In cases where an officer has not completed PME, but has completed one or more sub-courses of that PME, the officer may send correspondence to the President of the Board in accordance with paragraph 8 below, describing progress in completing the PME and include documented evidence of any sub-course completion. See references (f) and (g) for additional information regarding PME. 7.e. Civilian education. All officers must ensure their civilian education is accurately reflected in the Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS). 8. Officer Correspondence. All eligible officers are encouraged, but are not required, to submit correspondence to the President of the Board. OMPF materials sent directly to the President of the Board will not become part of an officer's OMPF. The following guidelines apply to Officer Correspondence: 8.a. Correspondence Template and Form. The letter or cover letter must be addressed to: President, FY27 USMC/USMCR (appropriate grade and competitive category) promotion selection board. A sample letter/cover letter is available at the officer promotion homepage. 8.b.Cover Letter and Enclosures. A letter to the board signed by the eligible officer with no additional enclosures does not require a cover letter. Correspondence with enclosures must be submitted under a signed cover letter by the eligible officer, with the material for the board's consideration listed as enclosures. Material submitted without a signed cover letter by the eligible officer will not be made available to the board. Communications or memorandums of recommendation from other parties on behalf of officers eligible for consideration will not be provided to the board unless forwarded as a listed enclosure under a signed cover letter. 8.c. Signature. Letters and cover letters from the eligible officer must be signed either with a pen or with a CAC digital signature by the eligible officer. 8.d. Correspondence Submission. All eligible officers may submit correspondence to their respective promotion selection board via the board correspondence Portal. 8.e. Board Correspondence Portal. Officers must have a valid USMC email to access the board correspondence Portal. Uploading material to the Board Correspondence Portal is the preferred and most accurate submission method. To access the CAC enabled Portal, go to: https://www2.manpower.usmc.mil/application_cac/. Officers can confirm their submissions via the Portal and WILL NOT receive separate confirmation of receipt from MMPB-10. Access to the Portal will be granted to eligible officers no later than 60 days before the board convene dates established in paragraph 1 of this MARADMIN. 8.f. Email. Alternatively, officers who do not have access to the portal may send their correspondence via email directly to the organizational mailbox:officerpromotions@usmc.mil. Ensure the email subject line reads \"correspondence to the FY27 USMC/USMCR (appropriate grade) promotion selection board.\" Documents should be titled as EDIPI_LASTNAME_Document Name.\" Correspondence sent via USMC email will receive an automatic email response, which serves as the official confirmation that CMC (MMPB-10) has received your update material. 8.g. Request for Non-Selection. Officers eligible for promotion who plan to separate or retire may correspond with the President of the Board requesting they not be selected for promotion. Any officer who writes such a letter to the board will still be considered for promotion and will incur a failure of selection if not recommended for promotion by the board. Per Title 10, U.S.C. Section 1174, an officer who submits a request not to be selected for promotion, or who otherwise directly causes his or her non- selection through written communication to the board, is not entitled to separation pay if involuntarily discharged from active duty. This pertains to all active-duty boards, with the exception of the CWO board. Requests for non-selection are subject to officer correspondence guidance provided in this MARADMIN. 8.h. Classified Reports. Eligible officers whose records contain classified reports should notify CMC, Officer Promotion Unit (MMPB-10) as soon as possible. Notification should include the Marines' full name, EDIPI, grade, occasion, and dates of the report(s). 9. In addition to the information in paragraph 8 above, Reserve Component officers should accomplish the following: 9.a. Career Retirement Credit Report (CRCR). The CRCR is provided to reserve boards as a quantitative measure of active participation. It is imperative that each officer review his or her CRCR. It is the responsibility of each officer to ensure the CRCR is accurate. Per reference (i), record audits will be conducted annually. Officers should identify discrepancies and provide updating or modifying CRCR information to their Inspector Instructor or Commanding Officer during these audits. Reserve unit commanders will correct discrepancies via the unit diary. IRR and IMA officers will receive an updated CRCR from the Marine Individual Reserve Support Organization (MIRSO) within 45 days of their anniversary date. The CRCR is also available in MOL under \"personal information,\" \"Career Retirement Credit Report.\" Per reference (i), corrections must be annotated and returned with supporting documentation (muster sheets, orders, historical NAVMC 798s, etc.) to MIRSO. The CRCRs are downloaded from MCTFS five working days before the date the board convenes and are subsequently provided to the board on the convening date of the board. 9.b. Reserve Qualification Summary (RQS). Per reference (i), Reserve officers, including Active Reserve (AR), eligible for consideration for promotion are highly encouraged to submit a complete RQS(NAVMC 10476) as officer correspondence to the board to arrive not later than 10 calendar days prior to the date the board convenes as outlined above in paragraph 8. The purpose of the RQS is to provide the board with information not included in other official records or fitness reports. The RQS must be submitted under a signed cover letter. 10. Post-board information and guidance. Officers may view the approval progress of their board from the officer promotion homepage. When the results of a field grade board are authorized to be released, a \"personal for\" (P-4) email will be forwarded to all Marine Corps general officers. The P-4 affords recipients an opportunity to ensure each select and in-zone non select are advised of their promotion status. The P-4 includes work phone numbers that are obtained from MCTFS. All officers are required to ensure their contact data is correct in MOL and MCTFS and to verify the accuracy of their MCC, unit, billet, phone and email information. Accurate, current contact information will facilitate more efficient notification. Approximately 5 working days after a P-4 is released, SECNAV will release the ALNAV announcing the names of the officers selected by the board. Captain and CWO board results will be announced via ALNAV when the board reports are approved by Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). 11. This MARADMIN is applicable to all Active and Reserve Component officers. All eligible officers have an obligation to prepare for promotion consideration and are reminded that they have a personal responsibility for the accuracy and completion of their own record. Commanding officers shall: 11.a. Ensure this MARADMIN and subsequent convening MARADMINs are available to all officers under their command. 11.b. Encourage all eligible officers to review their OMPF, MBS, and MCTFS data. 11.c. Ensure all reporting officials comply with fitness report timelines noted in reference (d). 11.d. Assist Marines with documentation missing from the OMPF, missing fitness reports or fitness reports requiring corrections. 12. Reference (k) announced changes to Joint Officer Management (JOM) and the Joint Qualification System (JQS). Active-duty Colonels eligible to be considered for selection to Brigadier General should familiarize themselves with the joint requirements. Colonels selected for Brigadier General cannot be promoted until they are designated a Joint Qualified Officer (JQO). 13. Colonels eligible to be considered for selection to Brigadier General and Brigadier Generals eligible to be considered for promotion to Major General will undergo pre-board adverse screening. This screening will be conducted by HQMC. Officers with adverse information will be contacted by HQMC and afforded an opportunity to comment on the adverse information prior to the board considering the information. 14.

On behalf of the entire Marine Corps, I wish to extend a heartfelt congratulations as you celebrate the 183rd Anniversary of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, the 158th Anniversary of the Civil Engineer Corps, and the 83rd Anniversary of the Naval Construction Forces. It is my honor to take a moment to recognize all that you have done and continue to do for your Marine Corps. 2. Since the establishment of the Navy Civil Engineer Corps in 1842 and the Navy's Civil Engineer Corps in 1867, the Marine Corps has greatly benefited from the faithful stewardship provided by your organization's military and civilian staff. Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command and Civil Engineer Corp officers remain vital to the success of Marine Corps installations providing efficient facility sustainment and management, executing mission critical construction, and working tirelessly to advance crucial quality of life initiatives to provide our Marines the safest and most comfortable environment possible. I thank the entire Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command team for your consummate professionalism and ability to adapt to the ever-changing needs and missions of the Marine Corps. 3. Since 1942, the Navy Seabees have been by our side answering our nation's call to crisis. Eighty years ago, Seabees were building and fighting alongside Marines throughout the Pacific, liberating Guam, Palau, the Philippines, and other islands as the nation island hopped to victory. To this day, Seabees and Marines train together on those same islands, conducting readiness exercises, completing humanitarian efforts such as Pacific Partnership, and continuing the long legacy of Seabee-Marine brotherhood. Together you continue to enable our Nation's readiness to respond to crisis and continue to support Marines wherever and whenever needed. 4. Let us not forget to reflect upon the sacrifices of all Navy Seabees and Civil Engineers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our great Nation. Marines around the world salute your dedication, courage, and unshakable resolve. 5. I am grateful for everything that the Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command, the men and women of the Civil Engineer Corps, and, of course, our cherished brothers and sisters in arms, the United States Seabees, bring to the fight. On behalf of our beloved Marine Corps, thank you. Your continued contribution to the sea services is vital and will never go unnoticed. 6. Happy Birthday to all of our Department of the Navy Installations, facilities and expeditionary partners and professionals! 7. Semper Fidelis, Eric M. Smith, General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.//"

Per refs (b) and (g), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected. This includes the physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section 10206 of ref (a). Ref (a) requires written notification to the officer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable. Commanding Officers must also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of administrative action. Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation. 4.b. Adverse Screening Process. Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or potentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10) removed the names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL). 5. Retirement and Transfer. Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion. An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component. 6. Accepting and Declining Promotion. Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted). To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade. Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline. 7. For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-1585 or DSN 278-1585. Email inquiries may be submitted via the Officer Promotions homepage at www.Manpower.Marines.mil. Email address is officerpromotions@usmc.mil. 8. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower Management Division.//"

The Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) Career Designation Panel 1 (CDP 1) convened on 6 February 2025 aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico. Based on the panel's recommendations, the Marines listed in the website link in paragraph 2.b.3. will be offered career designation (CD), allowing them to remain on active duty beyond their initial service obligation. 2. CD Process 2.a. The offer of CD is a milestone in a Marine officer's career. Commanders are required to counsel those officers who have been offered CD on the implications of either accepting or declining CD before that officer responds. In addition to speaking with their commander, officers considering declining CD should also reach out to their PMOS Monitor before declining the offer of CD. 2.b. Notifications 2.b.1. Upon release of this message, Retention and Release Officer (RRO) will notify all officers being offered CD via Marine Online (MOL). RRO will also notify commanders of those officers being offered CD via Commander's Messages in MOL. These messages may take 2-3 working days to appear in MOL after the release of this message. 2.b.2. RRO will notify all officers not being offered CD via MOL. RRO will also notify commanders of officers not being offered CD via Commander's Messages in MOL. Those officers who were not offered CD are eligible to screen on subsequent panels if their current Expiration of Active Service (EAS) date supports subsequent screenings. These messages may take 2-3 working days to appear in MOL after the release of this message. 2.b.3. A list of all officers offered CD is located on the following site: https://www.manpower.marines.mil/Manpower-Management/Officer-Assign ments/#tab/retention-and-release 2.c. Accepting or Declining 2.c.1. Officers offered CD must accept or decline the offer by responding to the MOL message no later than 2359 ET 18 March 2025. Officers who do not respond to this offer by the deadline will be considered as having declined CD and will execute their existing EAS. 2.c.2. Officers who accept CD will incur a 24-month active duty service obligation beginning 1 March 2025 and ending 1 March 2027. This obligation runs concurrently with, not in place of, any existing or future obligation incurred by PCS orders. Officers who accept the offer of CD will have their EAS changed to indefinite (00000000) upon acceptance. 2.c.3. Officers who decline CD will execute their current EAS. 2.d. Reporting and Administration 2.d.1. The RRO will report the offer of CD via Unit Diary Marine Integrated Personnel System (UDMIPS). Commands will be notified via the Diary Feedback Report (DFR) to the respective Installation Personnel Administration Centers (IPACs) per Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) Personnel Reporting Instruction User's Manual (PRIUM), paragraph 41001. This information will reflect on the Officer Data (OFFD) screen in MCTFS. 2.d.2. The following codes can be used to determine an officer's CD status in MCTFS: 1 - Active Screening on a CDP 2 - Offered CD 5 - Not Offered CD 6 - Accepted CD 7 - Declined CD / Did Not Respond 2.d.3. Admin Chiefs, Personnel Chiefs, Personnel Officers, Manpower Officers, IPACs and G1's can utilize the OFFD screen via MCTFS to verify officers who were offered, not offered, accepted, or declined CD. This information is resident in the MCTFS record and can be found as ACDU CAREER DESIG CODE and ACDU CAREER DESIG CONSIDER DT. 3. Remedial Career Designation 3.a. Under the Commanding General Remedial CD Program, Commanding Generals are authorized per MCO 1001.65A to nominate for remedial CD consideration those eligible Marines who were not offered CD on FY25 CDP1 to the RRO/Manpower Management Officer Assignments Branch (MMOA-3). 3.b. Officers who were not offered CD may request remedial nomination via the NAVMC 10274 Administrative Action (AA) Form. AA Forms must be addressed to the MARFOR Commanding General and endorsed by the officer's chain of command. 3.c. Officers who are nominated for CD under the remedial program must meet the qualifications specified in MCO 1001.65A. The nominees for remedial CD are due to MMOA-3 within 30 days of publication of this message for review and administrative action. 3.d. Consolidated nominations must be submitted via naval letter format from the MARFOR G1 level to MMOA-3 at smbmanpowerofficerpr@usmc.mil and must include the officer's EDIPI, full name, MARFOR, and PMOS. Files must be named EDIPI_LASTNAME_REMEDIALCD25 4. This message is not applicable to the Marine Corps Reserves. 5. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S.

A subsequent NSA selection panel in December 2024 confirmed the Marines identified in paragraph 5.a. as fully qualified for assignment to the CNODP. 3. Selection to the CNODP is a testament to the quality of the highly technically competent Marines whose participation in the program will further their development in the areas of secure system design, vulnerability analysis, computer network defense, and computer network exploitation. The selected individuals will join the cadre of technical leaders who will improve Department of Defense and Marine Corps cyber network operations capabilities. 4. Attendance and timelines 4.a. Selectees will begin Core Training in July 2025. Contact the Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command (MARFORCYBER) POC listed above for more details on the program. 4.b.

A declination renders a Marine ineligible for screening on future CNODP selection panels. 6.b. Alternates fleeted up to fill vacated CNODP quotas are also required to accept or formally decline via the procedure described above. 6.c. Deferrals. Marines selected for the CNODP by the panel who are unable to execute orders due to extraordinary life or professional circumstances may request a deferral. Primary selectees may submit a deferral request in writing (AA Form) to HQMC (MMOA-3) via the first O-6 commander in their chain of command. 6.d. All correspondence must originate from the selected Marine. In the case of AA forms requesting declination or deferral, Marines should scan all documents into a single portable document format (PDF) and email it to the MMOA SMB mailbox at: SMBMMOAPLANSO@usmc.mil. 6.e. Once a Marine accepts their selection and receives orders they are subject to references (b) and (c). 7. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower Management Division.//"

Per the references, the following guidance is the enduring military awards Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Season guidance. 3. Identifying Award Nominees. Prior to the start of the PCS season, unit award administrators (UAAs) should identify the outbound population for the command and publish this information to the command leadership. Award originators are to identify those high performing individuals deserving of Department of the Navy (DoN) personal military decorations (PMDs) and submit the appropriate recommendation via the improved Awards Processing System (iAPS). Nominations shall be submitted in a timely manner to ensure the award is complete prior to the anticipated presentation date. 4. DoN PMD Format and Processing. All DoN PMDs from Marine Corps Commands shall be originated in iAPS. 4.a. Summary of Action (SOA). Reference (g) limits the SOA for PMDs to two pages. Since the iAPS SOA field has no lines or character limit, award originators must ensure compliance by using the \"Print 11533 (PDF)\" button in iAPS, to verify that the SOA does not exceed two pages. A SOA is required for all PMD nominations from Marine Corps commands. 4.b. Citations and Certificates. Originators should carefully review the opening and closing sentences in reference (g). Awarding authorities are responsible for ensuring that the award produced and presented aligns with the approval in iAPS. The citation and certificate must be uploaded to the \"certificate\" section of the iAPS case to facilitate the inclusion of the award into the nominee's Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). Only the citation and certificate should be attached in the \"certificate\" section of iAPS. 4.b.1. Meritorious Service Medal and Above. To comply with reference (g), the character limit for the Meritorious Service Medal and awards of higher precedence is 1670 characters, and the citation should be written in standard case format. Meeting the character count in iAPS does not justify exceeding the line count for the citation, nor does meeting the line count justify exceeding the character count. 4.b.2. Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and Below. To comply with reference (g), the character limit for the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal iAPS citations/certificates will remain at 1250 characters, typed in all capital letters. Commands are authorized to deviate from the formatting requirements in reference (g) as identified below: 4.b.2.a. The font size must be between 8 and 12 pitch. 4.b.2.b. The left and right margins must be between 0.5\" and 1.0.\" 5. Timeline for Submission. Reference (g) states PMD nominations should be submitted to the final awarding authority for adjudication at least 60 days prior to the desired presentation date. Failure to meet this timeline may result in the PMD not being adjudicated in time for the intended presentation. The intent is for approved PMDs to be presented to the recipient prior to detachment or separation from the command in which the actions occurred. Award originators must plan the submission timeline based on the 60-day requirement. 5.a. In accordance with reference (h), awards approved by CMC, the nominations must reach CMC (MMPB-31) in iAPS NLT 60 days prior to the anticipated presentation date. 5.b. In accordance with references (g) and (h), awards approved by the SECNAV must reach CMC (MMPB-31) in iAPS NLT 90 days prior to the anticipated presentation date. 6. Requests to expedite PMDs awarded by CMC or higher authority. Requests to expedite PMDs will only be accepted in cases of retirement, relief and appointments, or changes of command. A request to expedite an award must be signed by the senior endorsing General Officer. A request to expedite an award reduces the number of votes required by the HQMC Military Awards Board. This does not, however, guarantee that the award will be completed by the desired presentation date. The request must include an explanation of why the award needs to be expedited. 7. Retirement and Separation Awards. 7.a. Meritorious Period End Date. Please note that the end date for the meritorious period of separation or retirement awards should be approximately two weeks prior to the retirement date or start of terminal leave. This ensures that the award can be reported in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and added to the Certificate of Release or Discharge (DD-214). Awards not reported in MCTFS prior to a Marine starting terminal leave, or retirement are typically not included on the DD-214. In such cases, the Marine must submit a request for correction to their DD-214 using Standard Form 180. 7.b. Other Service Originators. Those Marines who are retiring from a joint command may be nominated for a DoN award. The joint command should utilize the NAVMC 11533. A blank copy of the NAVMC 11533 can be found on the MMPB-31 website. Once the NAVMC 11533 has been endorsed by the first General or Flag Officer in the joint chain of command, it should be submitted to the MMPB-3 organizational mailbox. 8. Certificates of Commendation and Below. Although a SOA section exists in iAPS for Certificates of Commendation, a SOA is not required. Simply enter \"SOA not required\" in this field. Note that Meritorious Masts recommendations created in iAPS, are often erroneously forwarded to MMPB-31. To prevent an unsigned document from being uploaded to the OMPF, it is recommended that the award be originated by the awarding authority and that a signed certificate be uploaded prior to approval. 9. Combat Action Ribbon (CR) and Combat Conditions PMDs. It is possible to receive a PMD with a C device or a Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service under combat conditions, and not qualify for the CR. The awarding authority is responsible for ensuring the criteria contained in reference (g) are met for all CR or a combat condition award recommendations. 10. Common Mistakes regarding PMDs. 10.a. Incorrect opening or closing sentences. Specifically, on the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. Utilize Reference (g). 10.b. Inconsistent action dates on the NAVMC 11533 award form, SOA, citation, and certificate. 10.c. Incorrect Meritorious Period End Date for Marines separating from service. Specifically setting the date too late to allow for sufficient time for processing. 10.d. Inconsistent dates for award approval in iAPS and date on certificate, see reference (g). 10.e. Incorrect use of \"great credit\". \"Great credit\" is only used on awards of the Air Medal and above. 10.f. A commander approving an award for which they are not the awarding authority. 10.g. A commander directing an originator to rescind an award and originate a lesser award. Per reference (g), an award nomination may only be downgraded or disapproved by the official who has the authority to approve the award. 10.h. Award approved in iAPS does not match the citation and certificate presented to the recipient. 10.i. A Marine commander approving a DoN PMD for a foreign service member. 10.j. Attaching documents other than the signed citation or certificate in the \"certificate\" field in iAPS. The documents attached in the certificate section of the approved award are uploaded into the recipient's OMPF. Do not attach letters of transmittal or the NAVMC 11533. 10.k. Administrative Corrections should be submitted to MMPB-31 utilizing the template for administrative change requests on the MMPB-31 website. 11. This MARADMIN is applicable to the total force. 12. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower Management Division.//"

Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (h), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected. This includes the physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section 10206 of ref (a). Ref (a) requires written notification to the officer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable. Commanding Officers must also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of administrative action. Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation. 6.b. Adverse Screening Process. Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or potentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10) removed the names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL). 7. Retirement and Transfer. Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion. An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component. 8. Accepting and Declining Promotion. Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 2 through 5 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted). To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade. Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline. 9.

This message is a collaborative effort between Deputy Commandants (DC) for Programs & Resources (P&R) and Installations & Logistics (I&L) addressing the role of the IOs in the proper execution of CUECs 1, 2, 3, 9, hereby referred to as access management controls. IOs are command-appointed individuals responsible for managing system access. The Marine Corps must appoint and train IOs at every level to effectively implement access management controls in accordance with reference (a) and resolve the Financial Information Systems Access Controls/Segregation of Duties material weakness identified in reference (b). 2. Effectively immediately, all CGs, DCs, Commanders, and Directors at levels 1-4 in DAI must appoint sufficient IOs to: 2.a. CUEC 1: Ensure users complete annual cyber security awareness training and upload the training certificate in the Access Request Management System (ARMS). 2.b. CUEC 2: Ensure users complete all access provisioning requirements and that DAI access is terminated timely. 2.c. CUEC 3: Perform an annual DAI User Access Review (UAR). 2.d. CUEC 9: Resolve all identified segregation of duties (SOD) conflicts monthly. 3. Commands must identify a minimum of two IOs for each of these functional areas: Financial Management (FM), All Other Government, and Oracle Time and Labor (OTL). Some commands will need to appoint more than two IOs in each of these functional areas due to their high number of DAI users. Likewise, commands may nominate the same individual to be the IO for multiple functional areas with HQMC approval. 4. The typical IO distribution follows this structure: FM IOs reside within the Comptroller Section. All Other Government IOs reside within the Supply Section. All Other Government includes all personnel within the command involved in requisition operations. Commands have the discretion to appoint OTL IOs in either the Personnel/Manpower Section or Comptroller Section, depending on where payroll operations reside. 5. IO Appointment Process 5.a. Users must obtain and complete the IO Appointment Letter Memo template located at https:(slash)(slash)tso-confluence.mcw.usmc.mil/display/dkb/ dai+arms+access+request 5.b. The appointment letter must be signed by CGs, DCs, Commanders, Directors, or other designated officials authorized to sign by direction. 5.c. Users must upload the signed appointment letter and submit a new IO System Authorization Access Request (SAAR) in ARMS. 5.d. The P&R User Management (UMX) Section will review the required documentation and approve the IO SAARs appropriately. 6. L2 Commands must validate level 2-4 IOs with the P&R Systems and Data Integration (SDI) Division and the I&L Logistics Compliance Branch (LPC) every quarter to ensure that the organization can support DAI access management controls. 7. The minimum number of IOs is a requirement eligible for inspections. 8. Assistance for IOs requesting responsibilities in DAI can be located at https:(slash)(slash)tso-confluence.mcw.usmc.mil/display /dkb/dai+arms+access+request.

DABRIO/CIV/UNIT: DC PR SDI WASHINGTON DC/TEL: 571-733-7737/ E-MAIL: CHERYL.A.DABRIO@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. This message updates reference (a) and is a collaborative effort between Deputy Commandants (DC) for Programs & Resources (P&R) and Installations & Logistics (I&L) with the purpose of enhancing the implementation of DAI CUEC 9, hereby referred to as SOD controls. To manage risk effectively, comply with control standards, and achieve its financial statement audit goals, the Marine Corps must ensure that users with DAI access only have the necessary permissions required to perform their job functions. 2. Effectively immediately, all commands at levels 1-4 in DAI must resolve all identified SOD conflicts by either removing conflicting responsibilities from users or obtaining waivers from the designated authority. 3. As part of continuing actions, Commands will be required to support requests for information arising from the monthly review of SOD reports (Application Access Controls Governor and the Transactions Controls Governor reports). As part of this review, the P&R Systems and Data Integration (SDI) Division and the I&L Logistics Compliance Branch (LPC) will coordinate with applicable Commands to remediate identified SOD incidents. 4. Removing Conflicts. L1-L4 Commands must assess users' current DAI responsibilities and compare them to job requirements. Any identified conflict or unnecessary responsibilities must be removed by coordinating with the P&R User Management (UMX) Section. 5. Waivers. Some commands lack the personnel to distribute responsibilities between users per SOD requirements. Therefore, the Marine Corps has a waiver process to balance operational needs against compliance with control standards. 6. The SDI Division and the LPC Branch identified and reviewed applicable SOD conflicts. They ranked each conflict using a comprehensive review that assessed four risk criteria (fraud, audit, operations, and personable identifiable information). The analysis resulted in the following five risk categories and waiver paths: 6.a. Minimal risk conflicts will be adjudicated via an enterprise-wide waiver, and thus Commands are not required to address them. 6.b. Low risk conflicts will be adjudicated via waivers signed by the first General Officer in the chain of command. 6.c. Medium risk conflicts will be adjudicated via HQMC waivers. The SDI Director will adjudicate waivers for Financial Management (FM) and Oracle and Time Labor (OTL) personnel. The LPC Branch Head will adjudicate waivers for Other Government personnel. 6.d. High risk conflicts will be adjudicated via HQMC waivers. The Assistant Deputy Commandant P&R (Resources) will adjudicate waivers for FM and OTL personnel. The Assistant Deputy Commandant I&L Logistics Division will adjudicate waivers for Other Government personnel. 6.e. Waivers will not be granted for zero-tolerance risk conflicts. 7. Waiver Instructions 7.a. The SOD matrix, the risk register, waiver templates, and additional resources are available at https://usmc.sharepoint-mil.us sites/DCPR_SDI/Risk_Compliance/ 7.a.1. The SOD matrix provides a summarized view of the identified restricted role combinations. 7.a.2. The risk register provides a detailed view of SOD conflicts and the risk designation. 7.a.3. The waiver templates document the authorization for users to maintain SOD conflicts. There is a waiver template for each identified low, medium, and high-risk SOD conflict. 7.b. When users request a new responsibility through the access management system (i.e., ARMS), the system will identify if the new responsibility causes an SOD conflict, which requires a waiver to proceed. Users must coordinate with their respective Command Information Owners (IO) to initiate and submit waivers. 7.c. Command IOs must complete and submit to the designated authority a waiver request for each SOD conflict identified. 7.c.1. For low-risk SOD conflict, Commands should leverage their internal processes to submit and approve waivers. 7.c.2. For medium and high-risk SOD conflict, Command IOs must submit waivers using the Tier 1 Helpdesk JIRA process. 7.d. Users must upload the approved waiver to their profile in the access management system. The P&R UMX Section will validate the waivers. 7.e. If the request for a waiver is denied, the conflicting responsibility will not be granted or if it had already been granted, it will be removed. 8. When implementing the waivers, the following apply: 8.a. HQMC will evaluate and qualify the risk each SOD conflict poses to the enterprise annually and may result in conflicts being assigned to a different risk category. 8.b. Waivers are subject to periodic reviews to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness. They may be revoked or modified if it is determined that the risk level has changed or if compliance issues are identified. 8.c. Waivers are not automatically granted and will be voided when personnel are reassigned. The Marine Corps reserves the right to remove user responsibilities as necessary. All users must adhere to any mitigating controls established to minimize associated risks. Regular reviews and audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. 8.d. All DAI users have a fiduciary responsibility inherent in their roles as stewards of government resources and must report SOD conflicts and responsibilities that are no longer required to their respective IOs. 9. For specific questions, contact the following POCs: 9.1. FM personnel: Mr. Robert Burnand and Ms. Shajuana Nicholson. 9.2. All Other Government personnel: Ms. Sheila Warren. 9.3. OTL: Ms. Jessica Lynard-Kongkiat and Ms. Cheryl Dabrio. 10. This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force. 11. Release authorized by Anna N. K.

PHOEUK/CWO4/DIRECTOR/ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT DIVISION/ TEL: (703) 614-0929/EMAIL: SAMBO.PHOEUK@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. Purpose. This message serves as interim guidance pending update to MCO 5430.1 regarding the certification program for personnel assigned to Inspector General (IG) billets across the total force. 2. Background. 2.a. To preserve the Marine Corps' values, standards, and readiness as the Nation's expeditionary crisis response force, the Inspector General of the Marine Corps (IGMC) introduced a campaign plan in 2023 to enhance institutional readiness across the Service. A line of effort in this campaign plan focuses on the professionalization of the Marine Corps IG Enterprise. 2.b. The IGMC certification process is part of a deliberate strategy to create an authoritative and standardized process to build and sustain a professional IG workforce in the Service. The IGMC established the following framework that includes the required and tailored knowledge, skills, competencies, and abilities to achieve certification as a Marine Corps IG professional. These requirements apply to all uniformed and civilian IGMC personnel, command IG (CIG) personnel, and those serving in a Marine Corps IG capacity that directly perform IG functions as described in REF A. Collectively, this group of personnel comprises the Service's IG Enterprise. 3. Execution. 3.a. Certification Process. 3.a.1. IGMC's certification process includes three required milestones: 3.a.1.a. Milestone 1: Foundational Training (an online IGMC 101 Course provided on MarineNet as of 22 January 2025). 3.a.1.b. Milestone 2: Advanced Training (IGMC-facilitated Mobile/ Virtual Training Team (MTT/VTT)). 3.a.1.c. Milestone 3: Six months of satisfactory service in an IG- related billet within IGMC or a CIG office. 3.a.2. IGMC 101 is an online course currently provided on MarineNet (Course ID: IGMC101). IGMC Advanced Training is provided biannually by IGMC personnel via an MTT or VTT. 3.a.3. The IGMC is the sole Certifying Authority (CA) and will only award certification to IG personnel after validating completion of all training requirements and milestones. 3.a.4. As the CA, the IGMC may revoke or suspend certification based on unsatisfactory conduct or performance that is outside the ethical behavior, integrity, and professionalism expected of those serving in the Marine Corps IG Enterprise. 3.a.5. New IG personnel should attend an MTT/VTT at the first available opportunity, but not later than twelve months after being assigned or hired to an IG office. 3.b. Currency. In order for IG personnel to maintain currency of their IGMC certification, they shall complete the training requirements outlined below: 3.b.1. Annually, all IG personnel must receive at least one hour of ethics training led by an Ethics Counselor or through other IGMC- approved ethics training materials. The Counsel to the IGMC is the primary POC for determining other approved ethics training events. 3.b.2. Biennially, all IG personnel must attend one of the IGMC's Advanced Training MTT/VTT events. 3.c. Training Management and Accountability. 3.c.1. Personnel training and certification management is the responsibility of both the owning command and IGMC. CIG offices and IGMC Divisions shall provide IGMC with starting dates of new personnel, completion certificates for Foundational Training (Milestone 1), and facilitate enrollment and attendance of Advanced Training (Milestone 2). IG Enterprise personnel will upload information on to the IGMC sharepoint site: (https://usmc.sharepoint-mil.us/sites/igmc/tracker/SitePages/USMC-IG -Enterprise-Database.aspx). IGMC will publish instructions outlining where and how to upload this information via separate correspondence. 3.c.2. IGMC will maintain rosters for Advanced Training events and request data calls on a biannual basis to determine the completion of six months of satisfactory performance (Milestone 3) of new IG personnel. 3.c.3. CIG offices and IGMC Divisions shall record training completion by submitting an Electronic Personnel Administrative Request (EPAR) within MOL to their servicing Installation Personnel Administration Center (IPAC) to report via unit diary and record the associated Service School Codes for IGMC 101 (0AV) and Advanced Training courses (0AW) in the Marine Corps Total Force System for all uniformed IG personnel, and in the Total Workforce Management Services for civilian IG personnel. 3.d. Exception to Policy. 3.d.1. IGMC 101 is mandatory for all IG Enterprise personnel, regardless of time in billet or previous completed training. 3.d.2. IG Enterprise personnel who completed an MTT/VTT in CY23 or CY24 are exempt for two years from the date of training completion; their training counts for achieving certification Milestone 2. 3.d.3. The Service School Code for Advanced Training courses is active as of 1 June 2023. As such, IG personnel who completed an MTT/VTT in CY23, but prior to 1 June 2023, will list 1 June 2023 as their training completion date. 4. Coordinating instructions. 4.a. Continuous learning is essential to the sustainment of the Marine Corps IG Enterprise. Personal ownership to seek opportunities to advance competencies and skills will benefit both the individual and the Enterprise. Owning commands should encourage their IG personnel to attend professional development opportunities. Commands are responsible for resourcing attendance of these opportunities. IGMC will facilitate professional development opportunities by advertising IG training events via IG Connections (https://www.igmc.marines.mil/Divisions/Connections/). 4.b. IGMC will assess unit compliance to this guidance during IGMC inspections. 5. This message applies to all uniformed and civilian IGMC personnel, command IG personnel, and those serving in a Marine Corps IG capacity that directly perform IG functions as described in MCO 5430.1. 6.

Brockway/MAJ/MMSR-5/TEL: 703-784-9306/EMAIL: STEPHEN.BROCKWAY@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. Purpose. This MARADMIN provides guidance on the issuance of the DD Form 214-1, which will complement the traditional DD Form 214, ensuring a more comprehensive record of service for Marines transitioning or separating from Reserve duty. 2. Requirement. In accordance with reference (a), all Reserve Component Marines separated or released from their component on or after the date of this MARADMIN shall receive a DD-214-1. 3. Issuance of DD Form 214-1. The following Marines will be issued a DD Form 214-1 in conjunction with a DD Form 214: 3.a. Marines separated or released from a Reserve Component. 3.b. Reserve Component Marines transferred to the Individual Ready Reserve. 3.c. Reserve Component Marines transferred to the Standby Reserve or Retired Reserve. 3.d. Recalled retirees reverting to a retired status. 3.e. A complete list of qualifying circumstances for issuance are located in reference (a). 4. Exemption. The DD Form 214-1 is not required to be issued for: 4.a. Marines whose Reserve Component service is terminated by death. 4.b. Instances where the issuance of the DD Form 214 is not applicable. 5. Issuance Process. The DD Form 214-1, in conjunction with a DD Form 214, will be issued by the separation activity from which the Marine was separated and represents the standard record of service for Marines of the Reserve Component. The DD Form 214-1 will never be issued independently and will always be accompanied by the DD Form 214. In those instances where a DD Form 214/214-1 was not issued by the separation activity from which the Marine was separated, corrective action must be taken by the separation activity. 6. Preparation. Because the DD Form 214/5 Series is an essential record of service, preparation requires that: 6.a. Per reference (a), the DD 214-1, at the time of issuance, will contain a concise summary of service. 6.b. It is prepared accurately and completely and must be typed, or computer generated. 6.c. The recipient will be informed that making any unauthorized change or alteration of the form will render it void. 6.d. Abbreviations and acronyms should be avoided as much as possible. 6.e. The DD Form 214-1 business processes are in reference (a) and will be published to administrators via the Separation and Retirement Manual. Additional information is located on the MMSR website at https:(slash)(slash)www.manpower.marines.mil/Manpower- Management/Separation-and-Retirements-Branch/Inactive-Reserve- Separation-and-Retirement/ 7. This MARADMIN is applicable to the Total Force and will remain in effect until the revised Separation and Retirement Manual is published. 8. Release authorized by Lieutenant General Michael J. Borgschulte, Deputy Commandant, Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//"

This message announces the Spring Service-wide Cyber Capture the Flag (CTF) competition taking place on 12-29 May 2025. The Spring event will be a Cyber Blue Zone CTF, focused specifically on Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO). The Deputy Commandant for Information (DC I), in partnership with the National Cyber Range Complex (NCRC) under the DOD Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), will organize a remote CTF event with SECRET access provided through the Joint Information Operations Range (JIOR) and the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) Multiple Levels of Security (MILS) Network (JMN). The CTF competition provides a venue where Marine cyberspace operators can compete in a tailored scenario to complete cyber challenges of varying difficulty, referred to as cyber flags. 2. Background. On 1 March 2018, the Marine Corps established an occupational field dedicated to the professionalization of cyberspace operators. In January 2020, discussions began for developing a setting in which Marine cyberspace operators could compete, share expertise, and hone tactics, techniques, and procedures to increase cyberspace effectiveness and readiness across the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) and Cyberspace Mission Force (CMF) on a secure network. To address this challenge, DC I began hosting the Marine Corps Cyber Games and participating in CTF competitions. These events have provided a venue to foster camaraderie among the community and opportunities for Marines to display their skills in a competitive environment. Additionally, as has been the case in past CTFs, highly qualified cyber volunteers from the Marine Corps Cyber Auxiliary will be on standby to train, educate, assist, and mentor Marines as they compete. The intent of the Marine Corps Cyber Games is ultimately to accelerate excellence through competition. 3. Execution. The intended participants for this event are cyberspace operators from the DCO-IDM Companies and the Cyber Mission Force.

Purpose. To announce the Marine Corps Enlisted Career Designation Program (ECDP) pilot for senior enlisted Marines. 2. Background 2.a. The Commandant's guidance on Talent Management directed a paradigm shift from our legacy high turnover \"recruit and replace\" personnel model toward a greater emphasis on investment in and retention of our most capable Marines. Currently, enlisted Marines must submit retention requests at regular intervals that may not align with their duty assignments or career aspirations. This requirement can create uncertainty for our most experienced and skilled Marines and their families as they await determination on their continued service, adding an unnecessary administrative burden to Marines, commanders, assignment monitors, and Career Counselors. 2.b. The implementation of an ECDP pilot allows Staff Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) in the grades of E-8 and E-9 to voluntarily enter the ECDP upon their next reenlistment to serve to current Enlisted Career Force Controls (ECFC). 3. Program Overview 3.a. Eligibility. Effective 1 June 2025, Marines in the grades of E-8 and E-9 with an End of Current Contract (ECC) date before 30 September 2026 and at least 15 years of service or over two years time in grade will be eligible to submit their final reenlistment package to the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC), Manpower Management Enlisted Assignments (MMEA) to enter the ECDP. Marines electing not to enter ECDP will be required to submit for reenlistment upon future ECC dates to continue their service. An additional option will be made available for a Marine to enter into ECDP at the time of the next reenlistment. Marines must submit for reenlistment in accordance with reference (b). 3.b. Incurred Obligated Service. Initial reenlistment into ECDP incurs an additional 24-month service obligation starting at the end of their current contract. Enlisted career designated Marines will incur additional service obligations for, but not limited to, promotion, assignment, Selective Retention Bonus (SRB) payment, and Transfer of Education Benefits as appropriate in accordance with applicable corresponding guidance. 3.c. Assignments. Marines are required to obligate service in accordance with Joint Travel Regulations when executing a permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment orders. Marines who choose not to fulfill this obligation must submit a resignation as specified in reference (d) or request for retirement to Manpower Management Enlisted Assignments (MMEA) and Manpower Management Separations and Retirement (MMSR). 4. Separations 4.a. Retirement and Resignation. Individuals on the ECDP must request separation or retirement between 6 and 18 months of their Planned Retirement/Resignation (PRR) date. The requested PRR date will be no earlier than the date from which all obligations are satisfactorily fulfilled. 4.b. ECDP Marines who desire to resign instead of complying with assignment instructions must request separation within 30 days of receipt of orders. Upon CMC (MMSR) approval, Marines who are retirement eligible will receive a PRR date no later than the last day of the month following the estimated arrival date to the new duty station. Marines who are not retirement-eligible will receive a reenlistment code (RE) of RE-3O with a separation date six months from the Marine's RE-3O acknowledgement. 5. Selective Retention Bonus Program 5.a. Marines entering career designation and those already career designated may be eligible for an SRB based on military occupational specialty (MOS) requirements. To receive an SRB once in the ECDP, the Marine must complete a statement of understanding in coordination with the Marine's Career Counselor. 5.b. Marines receiving an SRB must commit to the requisite additional service outlined in the SRB MARADMIN. This obligation does not run concurrently with their initial entry into ECDP. 6. Reduction in Rank 6.a. Marines serving on the ECDP who are reduced in grade may exceed the applicable retention control point. If a Marine's reduction in rank exceeds their ECFC for that grade, the Marine will subsequently have an expiration of active service (EAS) modified not earlier than 4 months or later than 6 months after the effective date of the reduction in rank or removal of select grade as determined by CMC (MM). 6.b. Marines between 18 and 20 years of active service will be permitted to retire on the last day of the month following the month they reach 20 years of active service, unless administratively separated in accordance with reference (d). 6.c. Marines with at least 20 of years active service who exceed the service limitation for their current rank because of a reduction in rank or revocation of promotion selection must retire within 6 months after the effective date of the reduction in grade or revocation of promotion selection. 6.d. Marines can be involuntarily removed from the ECDP through administrative separation in accordance with reference (d). Career Marines who enter the ECDP will still be required to maintain all Marine Corps standards in accordance with applicable orders. 7. Administration 7.a. The establishment of the ECDP and the above policy and procedure refinements will be codified into all relevant Marine Corps Orders as they are revised. 7.b. Service-wide education of the ECDP will be provided to all general officer-level commands, Installation Personnel Administrative Centers, Enlisted Staff Academy, and the CMC's Cornerstone Commander's course. 7.c. A Marine entering the ECDP will have their final opportunity to sell back lump sum leave in conjunction with their reenlistment, per reference (b). Once in ECDP, Marines are unable to sell back leave unless they are executing separation or retirement. 8. This MARADMIN is not applicable to the Marine Corps Reserve. 9. Release authorized by Lieutenant General Michael J. Borgschulte, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//"

This message reminds users of the need to properly safeguard and protect CUI introduced into or through the Microsoft 365 (M365) office productivity and collaboration suite. 2. Situation. 2.a. The current system configurations and settings of M365 are set to enable maximum productivity of users of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network - Niprnet (MCEN-N)/unclassified. While the M365 system is capable of hosting CUI up to and including impact level 5 Data, it is incumbent on individual users to ensure that required controls are implemented to provide the appropriate level of protection beyond environment baseline configurations. Examples where CUI requires additional protections are in the cases of personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI). 2.b. Additionally, the power platform, which is accessed via M365, must be assessed for risk to the network. 3. Action. 3.a. MCEN-N users who generate or introduce cui into M365 are reminded of their responsibility for implementing required cybersecurity controls for their data. These include, but are not limited to, appropriate implementation of file access controls for files containing PII and implementation of access and audit controls for PHI. Failure to apply necessary controls may result in unplanned or unannounced removal of files from the network. 3.b. The program executive officer for digital and the supporting information system security manager for the M365 suite on the MCEN-N/Unclassified network will submit updated authorization documentation which includes the power platform suite of capabilities with associated cybersecurity controls, to the Marine Corps authorizing official for review, assessment, and certification no later than 31 May 2025. 3.c. No later than 31 May 2025, the United States Marine Corps authorizing official designated representative will publish guidance in accordance with ref (c) concerning risk management activities in support of development within the power platform to include remediation of already developed applications. 4. Direct all questions to message point of contacts. 5. Request widest dissemination of this message by addressees to subordinate commands. 6. Release authorized by Lieutenant General Melvin G.

To provide guidance to Budget Submitting Office-27 (BSO-27) Health Service Support personnel regarding the utilization of the Defense Medical Human Resources System internet (DMHRSi) in documenting all patient care labor at fixed Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) and Dental Treatment Facilities (DTF). 2. Background. Per reference (a), DHMRSi is the authoritative data system for military medical personnel labor allocation and must be used for documenting and reporting labor within a MTF or DTF. DMHRSi is essential to provide a timely and complete picture of the support rendered by the Marine Corps to the Military Health System (MHS), as outlined in references (a) through (d). Secondarily, it provides data relevant to tracking readiness and predictability of clinical support to the MTF/DTF. 3. Execution. 3.a. Per reference (a), all BSO-27 health services support (HSS) personnel involved in direct clinical care or clinical support at an MTF/DTF shall have an active DMHRSi account. Individuals, or their designees, shall use DMHRSi to report workload hours performed in any fixed MTF or DTF, to include all care provided within Marine Centered Medical Home (MCMH) clinics. 3.a.1. HSS personnel include all officers and enlisted personnel assigned to a BSO-27 unit as organic or temporarily assigned medical staff. 3.a.2. Designated clinical facilities are fixed MTFs and DTFs to include the MCMH. 3.a.3. This policy does not apply to care provided in the operational setting, such as: battalion aid stations, damage control resuscitation, damage control surgery, and facilities afloat (e.g., hospital ships and sick bays aboard ships). 3.b. Per reference (e), the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is responsible for DMHRSi training, account creation, timecard processing, and generation of workload data reports. 3.c. Per reference (e), DHA is responsible for providing adequate numbers of workstation computers with DMHRSi access for BSO-27 personnel at all designated clinical facilities to complete required documentation. Additional computer access can be obtained by coordination with the supported DHA command. 3.d. HSS personnel will be responsible for entering workload data into DMHRSi weekly. Workload data required includes, but is not limited to, time spent in: 3.d.1. Direct patient care in both the inpatient and outpatient clinical settings. 3.d.2. On-call hours supporting patient care, whether they are directly involved in care or not. 3.d.3.

As we observe the increasingly rapid rate at which the character of warfare is changing, the Marine Corps obligation to confront these challenges head-on becomes ever more critical. Marine Aviation must lead the Service's efforts to proactively evolve our platforms, personnel, and operating concepts to sustain our warfighting edge. The Deputy Commandant for Aviation (DCA) will host the 2025 Marine Aviation Readiness and Operations Summit (MAROS) at the Hyatt Regency Dallas in Dallas, TX from 12-16 May 2025. 2. The focus of this year's MAROS is the 2025 Marine Aviation Plan and the continued efforts to modernize our fleet while embracing innovative concepts and fostering a digital data-centric culture. DCA's intent for MAROS 2025 is to capture Operational Advisory Group (OAG) needs then align and prioritize them to ensure Marine Aviation continues to deliver unrivaled maneuver, firepower, tempo, and multi-domain integration. 3. MAROS is intended to allow subject matter experts from within Marine Aviation to conduct annual meetings in one centralized location. MAROS consolidates and synergizes efforts previously held at different times and locations, reducing aggregate costs and enabling one forum that allows a professional exchange of information on topics essential to Marine Aviation to include readiness, aviation programs, warfighting lessons learned, professional development, and tactics. 4. OAGs are directed to conduct the majority of their community's work prior to MAROS. MAROS is intended to be a venue where senior leader guidance, cross-community discussions, and industry engagement can be used to provide refinement to OAG deliverables. The OAG out briefs at MAROS will be in the form of info-only briefs to senior leaders that will inform follow-on conversations and future community initiatives. Decision briefs requiring MAB approval must be coordinated with HQMC Aviation via separate correspondence through the appropriate HQMC AVN Branch Head. 5. All MAROS events will take place in conference rooms at the Hyatt Regency Dallas, 300 Reunion Blvd, Dallas, TX 75207. 6. Overview of events. A separate and more detailed schedule, to include registration, will be sent out from each POC listed in paragraph 10. 7. Uniform will be smart casual (polo/collared shirt, sport coat optional) for meetings taking place during normal working hours at the Hyatt Regency Dallas.

This message initiates the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) Special Duty Assignment (SDA) Screening Team (HSST) screening process. HQMC selects and assigns the most qualified and capable Marines to duties as a Recruiter, Drill Instructor, Combat Instructor, and Marine Security Guard (MSG) Detachment Commander. 2. Eligible Marines. Manpower Management Enlisted Assignments (MMEA) will release the list of Marines that meet the criteria for assignment to SDA via the Total Force Retention System (TFRS) on or about 1 March 2025. The identified Marines must be screened by Commanding Officers, utilizing the instructions and checklists available per reference (a). 2.a. Volunteer Consideration. Per reference (e), Marines with an active and complete volunteer Reenlistment, Extension, and Lateral Move (RELM) for an SDA (Recruiting, Drill Instructor, Combat Instructor or MSG Detachment Commander) and a RELM \"Submitted Date\" of 28 February 2025 or earlier will be considered a volunteer for SDA. Marines with a request for a non-SDA screen-able duty (i.e., MSG WatchStander) that is still pending in TFRS after 1 March 2025 will not be considered SDA volunteers and may be required to submit HSST screening materials if identified for HSST screening and if disapproved for the initial request. 3. Submission Guidelines. Commands will submit completed SDA packages on all identified Marines to MMEA electronically via a TFRS SDA RELM request no later than 15 April 2025. Marines who do not submit by this deadline will be assumed eligible and be directly assigned to an SDA. 3.a. SDA RELMs that exceed 14 days in a Pending Additional Information status may be pulled back to HQMC for processing. 3.b. Marines with an End of Current Contract (ECC) prior to 30 September 2026 will submit a completed SDA package to MMEA electronically via TFRS RELM request as \"SDA / Reenlistment / HSST\" RELM type. Each package will include, at a minimum the items listed in paragraphs 3d-3k. 3.c. Marines with an ECC of 1 October 2026 and beyond will submit completed SDA packages to MMEA electronically via TFRS RELM request as \"SDA w/ Extension / HSST\" RELM type. Each package will include, at a minimum the items listed in paragraphs 3d-3k. 3.d. The applicable Screening Checklists per paragraph (3k) and Financial Worksheet, per reference (a) are available via TFRS. 3.e. Only close up photos of tattoos visible in PT gear must be attached. Screening documents must include a detailed description, size, location, meaning, and the date received for each tattoo. 3.f. Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) authorized, must reflect \"Fully Medically Ready\". 3.f.1. IMR usage removes requirement for Medical Officer signature on an SDA RELM unless deemed not qualified for SDA. 3.g. Records of disciplinary actions in Marine's service record. 3.h. Chain of command RELM comments and recommendations. Commander recommendations must address retention and the SDA request. 3.i. Security Clearance Eligibility Letter. 3.j. Fitness Report Inventory. 3.k. Checklists must be completed for Marines pertaining to the Marine's grade. 3.k.1. Corporals and Sergeants: Recruiting Duty and Drill Instructor Duty checklists are required. Combat Instructor checklists are required for infantry and female Marines only. 3.k.2. Staff Sergeants and Staff Sergeant selects: Recruiting Duty, Drill Instructor, and MSG Detachment Commander checklists are required. Combat Instructor checklists are required for infantry and female Marines only. 3.k.3. Staff Sergeants and FY25 Staff Sergeant selects must submit their Phase II screening form to the MSG Recruiting, Advertising, and Screening Team (RAST) via the following email: MCESG-RAST@groups.state.gov. An MSG RAST email confirming receipt of the Phase II screener must be attached to the TFRS SDA RELM. 4. For Marines unqualified for SDA, Commanders will provide source documentation of disqualifying criteria and/or estimated return date to a qualified status to determine SDA class assignment and retention accurately via a TFRS \"SDA Only\" request. 4.1. Examples include Medical Officer prognosis letters for projected date of SDA assignability, legal documents that should cause date conflicts with SDA class dates, page 11 entries for assignment to Body Composition Program, or physical fitness test/ combat fitness test failures. 4.2. Unit Diary entries must be reflected in the Marine Corps Total Force System for the disqualifying status to validate disqualification. 5. Marines not directed for HSST screening but who want to volunteer for SDA are encouraged to continue to submit applications per paragraph 3. 6. HSST members will screen electronic packages and assign qualified Marines to available SDA classes. During the screening, HSST members make SDA class assignments on a \"first-come, first-serve\" basis per each Marine's qualifications, command recommendations, and remaining SDA vacancies upon receipt of the SDA package. 7. HSST assignments are announced via separate correspondence, and a by-name list will be published via TFRS NLT August 2025. 7.a. Upon return of the approved RELM with a designated class assignment to the unit, Marines will have no more than 15 days to accept the obligated service. Those Marines that decline to gain the obligated service necessary for their assignment to an SDA will be issued a RE-3O reenlistment code per references (c) and (d). 8. Commanders must re-certify Marines between 60 and 45 days before their SDA class report date to ensure they remain qualified. Failure to properly re-screen Marines for SDA will result in a determination of non-compliance. 9. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower Management Division.//"

PAUGH/GYSGT/SNCOIC, MARKSMANSHIP PROGRAM MANAGEMENT SECTION (MPMS), WTBN QUANTICO, TEL: 703 784-5450/EMAIL: WTBN_QUAN_MPMS@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. Per reference (a), the Commanding General, Training and Education Command serves as the sponsor for the Marine Corps Combat Marksmanship Program (MCCMP). Commanding General, Training Command staffs and distributes products developed by MCCMP Proponent. The Commanding Officer, Weapons Training Battalion (WTBn) Quantico, serves as the Marksmanship Proponent. The Director of the Marksmanship Program Management Section (MPMS), WTBn Quantico, serves as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for items in the MCCMP order. MPMS develops, maintains, and updates all master lesson files and other supporting documentation for conducting marksmanship training throughout the Marine Corps. MPMS has direct liaison authority with other commands where necessary and appropriate to accomplish these efforts. 2. WTBn Quantico hosted the FY25 Combat Marksmanship Symposium (CMS) from 16-18 October 2024. The CMS provides a single forum for key leaders from across the Total Force to consider combat marksmanship issues and subsequently provide senior leadership an accurate picture of the Service's current marksmanship state along with recommendations for the future. Reference (e) is the Marine Corps Marksmanship Campaign Plan (MCP), which was signed on 16 September 2024, and charged the Force to realize a quantitative increase in individual Marine and unit lethality to meet the demands of the future operating environment. The FY25 CMS was conducted with the explicit focus on realizing the MCP vision in its entirety. Post-CMS, TECOM's Marksmanship Working Group (MWG) will ensure the MCP's specified tasks are completed as directed. 3. The FY25 CMS included the following working groups (WG): Entry-Level Qualification (ELQ), the Marksmanship Instructor Training Continuum, Joint Marksmanship Assessment Package (JMAP) Fielding, Precision Marksman and Advanced Precision Marksman Way Forward, and Infantry Marksmanship Assessment standardization at the Schools of Infantry (SOI). 4. At the CMS's conclusion, the following items were brought forward for MCCMP sponsor and proponent review and decision, and all were approved: 4.a. The ELQ WG developed the plan to achieve MCP task IO 1.1.1 and 3.3.2. IO 1.1.1 directs the development of a training program to progress a Marine from having never fired a weapon to qualifying with an Annual Rifle Qualification (ARQ)-like evaluation and ultimately with a complete ARQ evaluation by FY29. IO 3.3.2 directs a proof-of-concept test on recruit populations firing the ARQ and building on the success of ongoing entry-level officer ARQ implementation. 4.b. Marksmanship Instructor Training Continuum. To reduce redundancy and increase efficiency between four different marksmanship courses, WTBN-Quantico will conduct a proof-of-concept course beginning in third quarter FY25. This proof-of-concept will consolidate the associated tasks between the existing courses and increase instructor capacity. Instructor development will account for planned fielding of JMAP IAW reference (e). Further discussion will be conducted at the FY26 CMS. 4.c. Precision Marksmanship. The CMS included extensive discussions focused on the intent to have one precision marksman (PM) per rifle squad in each infantry battalion along with the future Advanced PM leadership billet tasked in Ref (e). Both items will be the focus of a Total Force Operational Planning Team (OPT) to be conducted in January 2025, with further OPT details released SEPCOR. 4.d. SOI Standards for the Infantry Marksmanship Assessment (IMA) and Rifleman Marksmanship Assessment (RMA). 4.d.1. WTBN-Quantico IMA and RMA guidelines to the SOIs via separate correspondence coinciding with this message. The guidelines will include event setup, execution, and administrative instructions to ensure standardized execution of the events. The standards or minimum scores required for each stage of the IMA and RMA are effective with this message and will be re-assessed on 1 April 2025. 4.d.2. The zero stage of the IMA and RMA was not previously recorded with sufficient data points to establish a clear minimum standard. IAW the revised guidelines, the zero stage will be recorded to collect data without a minimum requirement, which will allow for a revised standard to be implemented on 1 April 2025. 5. The CMS met its intent to gain a clear picture of the current state of Marine Corps marksmanship and the next steps required to achieve the MCP vision. WTBN-Quantico shall draft a calling message for the FY26 CMS in May 2025 announcing the symposium dates, anticipated topics based on the MCP, and to solicit further inputs from the Total Force. 6. Contact the POCs for any requests for information. 7. Release authorized by Lieutenant General Benjamin T. Watson, Commanding General, Training and Education Command.//"

All applicants must be prepared to move in the early summer of FY26, if selected. The International Affairs Program (IAP) seeks qualified officers to serve in Joint SCO billets with respective Combatant Commands (CCMD). The board will select officers based on their specific political-military and security cooperation experience, language, regional expertise, and cultural (LREC) skills, and performance as Marine Air Ground Task Force officers. Per ref (b), SCOs serve in influential strategic-level positions where they are the foremost points of contact between the Department of Defense and the host nation Ministry of Defense, other government agencies, small businesses, and academia. SCOs are located in or associated with U.S. diplomatic facilities worldwide and are responsible for overseeing and implementing in-country security cooperation events, to include security assistance programs, and for facilitating cooperation in research, development, and acquisition with allied and partner nations. 1.a.

WELTZIEN/MAJ/DCI RESERVE LIAISON/TEL: 703-692-1395/ EMAIL: MATTHEW.WELTZIEN@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. Purpose. In accordance with the references, this message outlines the Active Duty and Reserve Marine Corps Attach\u00e9 (MARA) program, the procedures for consideration for service with the Defense Attach\u00e9 Service (DAS), and solicits applications for the FY27 MARA program. The board selects Marines based on Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) experience and performance, and slates Marines based on their specific language, regional expertise, and cultural skills. 1.a. Major timeline milestones are below (read in three columns). Date Milestone Note Release of this message Applications open 31 March 2025 Applications due 05 May 2025 Board convenes Sep - Dec 2025 Results released 1 Note 1: Following approval of primary selects by the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV), Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA) releases the results of the FY27 MARA Selection Board anytime from September to December 2025. Results may be delayed due to SECNAV approval. 2. MARAs fill influential, strategic-level positions within embassy country teams. Depending on the specific billet and country, they serve as the direct representative of the Secretary of Defense, the SECNAV, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, geographic combatant commanders, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. MARAs may also serve as the Senior Defense Official/Defense Attach\u00e9 (SDO/DATT) at particular embassies. SDO/DATTs direct, control, operate, and administer the Defense Attach\u00e9 Office to which assigned. Attach\u00e9 duties vary by country, but all personnel will advise the Chief of Mission on military matters. 2.a. Reserve attach\u00e9 program. Reserve attach\u00e9s' primary purpose is to augment the DAS utilizing drills and annual training periods, 30-60 continuous days in the National Capital Region (NCR) or abroad per year. However, they may also have opportunities to support while on longer term Active-Duty Operational Support orders for periods of three months to two years based on operational MARA gaps. Reserve attach\u00e9 program selectees will be assigned to a geographic division and utilized based on DAS priorities, Marine availability, suitability, and funding availability. 3. Eligibility criteria. Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) Marines who meet the following criteria are eligible to apply. 3.a. Grade and career timing 3.a.1. AC applicants must meet the grade criterion (or be selected for promotion to that grade) and possess the career timing to serve a full tour of duty in the grade of the billet for which they are applying. Lieutenant Colonel applicants must plan to opt-out of consideration for promotion if selected if they enter the in-zone population at any time during their anticipated tour of duty and must agree to do so in their application if selected. 3.a.2. Enlisted Marines in grade of E-5 to E-8. E-5s must have two years TIG. 3.a.3. RC applicants must belong to one of the following categories of the ready reserve: Selected Marine Corps Reserve, Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA), Individual Ready Reserve, or AC with a transfer date to the Ready Reserve before the end of FY25. 3.a.4. AC Marines must be a FY26 mover based upon their current prescribed tour control factor (TCF). If selected, Marines will depart their current duty station in FY26 to attend training prior to reporting to their assigned country in FY27. 3.a.5. If an applicant does not meet their prescribed TCF requirements in paragraph 3.a.4, they must submit a exception to policy (ETP), endorsed by the first O-6 in the chain of command, via NAVMC 10274 (AA-Form), with their application. Transfer inside of the prescribed TCF will result in a gap for that command until the TCF has concluded. If an officer is selected prior to his/her normal rotation date, Manpower Management Officer Assignments (MMOA) will attempt to provide a backfill. A commander's endorsement of the AA Form is considered acknowledgement of this situation. MMOA will adjudicate the ETP separately from the board process and must be approved by MMOA before a Marine will be considered for a MARA billet vacancy. An officer with an approved ETP will be a FY26 mover regardless of selection to the MARA program. 3.a.6. AC applicants must include email correspondence from their PMOS monitor. RC applicants must include email correspondence from RAM-1 confirming their eligibility for this program by using SMB_RAM-1@USMC.MIL. The board will not consider applications without PMOS monitor or RAM confirmation. Service requirements and other manpower considerations may preclude eligibility IAW ref (b). 3.a.7. Per references (a) and (b), AC applicants must have completed a Single Scope Background Investigation or Top Secret (TS) Security Investigation and have Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) eligibility to apply. Application to the MARA program is not sufficient justification for an investigation eligibility determination for AC applicants. Officers and Marines selected by the board will be required to either have a current (within the last five years) counterintelligence scope polygraph or obtain one prior to attending the Joint Military Attach\u00e9 School (JMAS). For questions regarding clearances, contact USMC HQMC Special Security Office at 703-693-6005 or hqmc_sso@usmc.mil. 3.a.8. RC Marines without TS/SCI eligibility may apply, however, if a reserve primary selectee does not have TS/SCI eligibility, the Marine will be submitted for and must obtain a TS/SCI clearance before transferring to the IMA and subsequently pass a counterintelligence-scope polygraph before starting the Reserve Support Course (RSC). 3.a.9. RC Marines must have had four satisfactory years of service (50 points minimum each year) during the last five years. 4. Ineligibility criteria 4.a. Marines with an established separation or retirement date. 4.b. AC Captains and Majors in the Above-Zone (AZ). LtCols in the AZ will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 4.c.

These officers may request consideration by contacting their PMOS monitor. 4.j. AC Marines without TS/SCI clearance eligibility. 5. Additional considerations 5.a. Language, regional expertise, and culture skills are highly desirable but are not prerequisites. 5.b. Families are an important element of the MARA program. Attach\u00e9s are encouraged to take their families to most assignments. Applicants with dependents enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Program are eligible to apply but may not be able to participate pending availability of required care. 5.c. Foreign-born Marines are not eligible for assignment to the country in which they were born. 5.d. Spouses of AC applicants must be naturalized US citizens. Applicants will not be eligible for assignment to the country in which the spouse was born. For RC applicants, spouses are not required to be naturalized US citizens for the applicant to serve in the Reserve Attach\u00e9 Program. 5.e. Applicants will not be eligible for assignment to a country in which immediate family members still maintain citizenship. Applicants should identify in their application letter whether any of their immediate family are not US citizens or dual citizens. Immediate family members include parents, stepparents, siblings, and children. 5.f. Dual Active-Duty applicants must have concurrence from both monitors and be willing to forego co-location if selected. This should be annotated in the MARA application. 6. Training 6.a. AC Training. AC Marines selected for the program will attend JMAS, conducted over approximately 13 weeks at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in Washington, DC. Marines who successfully complete this training are then available for assignment abroad. Language training is also required for most billets. The length of language training will be based on the language and proficiency level required. Training start dates are dependent upon the country to which selected, JMAS, and the language training (up to 64 weeks in duration). In some cases, this training may start as early as Spring 2026. Active Duty officers serving as MARAs are administratively controlled by the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA) throughout training and while assigned to their respective countries. 6.b. RC Training. Reserve Attach\u00e9s selected for the program must complete both the RSC and Geographic Division Training/Familiarization before serving overseas. RSC is a resident one-week introductory course taught by the JMAS annually, usually in December, at DIA in Washington, DC. 7. AC vacancies.

COLON/GS11/RAM/TEL: (703) 432-9590/E-MAIL: RAM-1(AT)USMC. MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/ 1. Purpose. This MARADMIN provides a consolidated source of information and guidance for officers transitioning from the Active Component (AC) to the Reserve Component (RC). Additionally, it provides amplifying guidance for the creation and processing of the NAVMC 763. 2. Background. In accordance with reference (a), the President shall have the power to appoint officers of the United States. Reference (b) delegates the appointment of armed forces officers to the Secretary of Defense. References (c) and (d) state that officers on the Active-Duty List (ADL) will have a Regular appointment and all officers on the Reserve Active-Status List (RASL) will have a Reserve appointment. The ADL contains all AC officers and the RASL contains all RC officers. Reserve appointments for officers transitioning from the AC to the RC require a minimum of four months from the date received at Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) for approval. In cases where the officer was subject to adversity this timeline is increased. 3. Process 3.a. Transferring after initial obligation 3.a.1. Regardless of commissioning source, an AC officer's initial contract in the Marine Corps is for a period of eight years. The first portion of the eight-year obligation is typically performed in the AC. If an officer separates from the AC before their military service obligation of eight-years is completed, they will be transferred to the RC to complete the required service obligation in accordance with reference (e). An officer can view their end of obligated service (EOS) date within their Basic Individual Record within the Marine Online website. CMC(RA) will identify and submit qualified officers for a Reserve commission via the Secretary of Defense. 3.a.2. Officers who have prior enlisted service may be beyond their EOS date upon end of active service (EAS) during their initial AC officer contract. If an officer in this scenario separates at their EAS and desires to transfer to the RC, they must ensure their separations code in block 26 of their DD-214 indicates this intent. CMC(RA) will identify and submit such officers for a Reserve commission via the Secretary of Defense automatically. No further action is required on behalf of the officer. 3.b. Transferring after career designation 3.b.1. Officers who have accepted career designation, completed all AC obligations, and desire to transfer to the RC must request to resign their AC commission in accordance with chapter five of reference (e). Once the resignation has been approved and an EAS is populated in the resigning officer's record, CMC(RA) will submit for a Reserve commission via the Secretary of Defense. 3.b.2. AC officers who submit for consideration on an Active Reserve Accession Board will be submitted for a Reserve commission by CMC(RA). 3.b.3. Officers with special circumstances who request to separate from the AC and transfer to the RC inside of the four-month window, outlined in reference (g), must immediately notify the Reserve Affairs Officer Appointment Manager via RAM-1(at)usmc.mil to determine if the request is viable. 4. Notification 4.a. RA does not directly notify individual officers who are approved for a Reserve commission. Approval is reflected in the planned separations code within Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS). 4.b. RA will notify any officer who requested to transition to the RC but is deemed ineligible due to substantiated adversity in accordance with reference (g). 5. Acceptance of a Reserve Commission 5.a. Per reference (h), the acceptance of a Reserve commission is documented on an Appointment Acceptance and Record (NAVMC 763). It is the single proof source legal document maintained within an officer's Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). The NAVMC 763 serves as evidence of the legal basis by which both commissioned and warrant officers discharge their sworn duties and provides the foundation for validating an officer's retirement eligibility and entitlements. 5.b. Unit administration or the section handling the records of a separating officer must produce an updated NAVMC 763 correlating to officers' MCTFS record. This updated NAVMC 763 must be issued to the separating officer before their separation takes place. The separating officer is responsible for obtaining a signature from an Administering Officer who is higher in grade than the separating officer. After obtaining the signature, the officer must return the completed NAVMC 763 to the issuing section. The issuing section must upload the completed NAVMC 763 to the officer's Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). The IPAC will be responsible for ensuring the DD-214, NAVMC 763, and all records related to the officer's separation are accurately updated and stored in their OMPF. If an IPAC is unavailable, the reporting unit will take responsibility for updating and properly storing the DD-214, NAVMC 763, and all separation-related records in the officer's OMPF. 5.c. Approval for a Reserve commission is reflected within the planned separation code within MCTFS. 5.d. Guidance on how to properly complete the NAVMC 763 for officers transferring from the AC to the RC is as follows: 5.d.1. Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5a, 5b, 6, 7, 9, 9a, 10, 11, 13, 14, 14a, 15, 15a, and 17 shall coincide with the officer's current status and current data within MCTFS using Marine Corps database codes in the manpower codes lookup guide at https: (slash)(slash) www2.manpower.usmc.mil/lookups/lookups/lookups.action. Note all item dates shall be in the following format (MM DD YYYY). 5.d.2. Items 8, 8a, 8b, 12, 12a, 16, and 16a will be \"N/A\". 5.d.3. Items 18 and 18a are the component and code the officer is transferring to (\"USMCR\" for 18 and \"K7\" for 18a). 5.d.4. Item 19 is \"N\" (not assigned immediately to active duty). 5.d.5. Item 20 is \"8A\" for transfer from the AC to the RC (EAS or resignation) or \"8I\" for Captains twice passed over for promotion. 5.d.6. Item 20a is \"12203\". 5.d.7. Item 20b is \"TRANSITIONAL\". There is not a specific program for this section when transferring from the AC to the RC. Transitional is appropriate. 5.d.8. Item 21 shall contain all prior service to include the end date of the current component place in column (d) which must correspond with the date entered on block 12b from the individual's DD-214 release from active-duty date, prior to switching to the new component listed in item 18. \"(not creditable for pay purposes)\" shall be typed across the (a), (b), and (c) columns, above the required item information, for each component period of military service that is not creditable for computation of basic pay in accordance with reference (f). The \"EFF DATE\" below item 21 is the day that the component change is to take effect. This should be the day after the officer's EAS, which shall be the day after last entry in column 21d and block 12b from the officer's DD-214. 5.d.9. Item 22 shall be signed by the applicable officer. Fill in as \"subscribed and duly sworn to before me at (location) this (number date) day of (month and year)\". Example \"subscribed and duly sworn to before me at MCB Quantico, VA this 10th day of November 1775\". 5.e. Distribution of the completed NAVMC 763 is an essential part of the officer's record and must be uploaded by the separating section into the officers OMPF by visiting https:(slash)(slash) www4.manpower.usmc.mil/orma/#/then you can access the Records Management Application(O-RMA). 6. Training. Instructional training can be found at https:(slash) (slash) www.marinenet.usmc.mil/mvs/v.aspx?Id=6350B3B28CE6 7. Command and Signal. The point of contact for Reserve commission questions can be directed to RAM-1(at)usmc.mil. 8. This MARADMIN cancels MARADMIN's 356/12, 356/12 and 369/17. 9. Release authorized by LtGen Michael J. Borgschulte, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//"

This message establishes the provisions for eligibility and selection to the Marine Corps Doctor of Philosophy Program (PHDP) and provides guidance for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) PHDP Selection Board implementation. Nested in the overarching program are two fully-funded education tracks: the Marine Corps Doctor of Philosophy Strategist Program (PHDP-S) and the Marine Corps Doctor of Philosophy Technical Program (PHDP-T). This MARADMIN solicits for applications to both. Applications are due no later than 2359 on 4 April 2025. Following application submission, candidates will be contacted to schedule interviews as required. 1.a. Major milestone timeline (read in two columns): NLT Date Milestones 31 January 2025 Survey and Application open 04 April 2025 Applications due 25 April 2025 PHDP Interviews complete 29 April 2025 PHDP Board convenes 1.b. The purpose of the PHDP is to provide the Marine Corps a cohort of strategic and highly technical thinkers to support senior leader decision making, assist in developing defense and Service strategies, and to help inform long range concept and capability development areas. Furthermore, uniformed officers with doctorate- level education provide deployable, highly-skilled support to senior leaders, and help generate national, defense, and Service strategies in an increasingly complex world. 2. Eligibility 2.a. PHDP-S 2.a.1. Unrestricted active duty officers: majors (select), majors, and lieutenant colonels with less than 19 years commissioned service by 31 July 2027. This ensures that officers selected will have the career timing to complete a three-year education tour and six years of service obligation prior to the 28-year service limitations for lieutenant colonels. 2.a.2. Officers who will have no less than two years' time-on-station by the start of PHD coursework (estimated July 2026). 2.a.3. Hold at least a Secret clearance and be eligible for a Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearance. 2.a.4.

Officers with a Graduate Record Examination (GRE) taken no earlier than 1 January 2021. Competitive GRE scores are generally considered minimums of 153 verbal reasoning, 156 quantitative reasoning, and 4.0 analytical writing. 2.a.6. Applicants may request a waiver on a case-by-case basis when a civilian institution's doctoral program prerequisites differ from these minimum standards, however GREs help the board assess an applicant's competitiveness for acceptance to high quality PHD programs. 2.b. PHDP-T 2.b.1. Unrestricted active duty officers: career designated captains, majors, and lieutenant colonels with less than 19 years commissioned service by 31 July 2027. This ensures that officers selected will have the career timing to complete a three-year education tour and six years of service obligation prior to the 28-year service limitations for lieutenant colonels. 2.b.2. Officers who will have no less than two years' time-on-station by the start of PHD coursework (estimated July 2026). 2.b.3.

The purpose of the strategist program is to select up to two officers to fill Marine Corps requirements for doctorates with a focus on strategic affairs. This track is designed for candidates to complete coursework within two academic years and a dissertation within one academic year. Traditionally, officers have been encouraged to attend universities in the NCR, however many officers have been accepted and successfully completed PHD programs at top-tier institutions outside of the NCR. As a result, the board will pay particular attention to an applicant's propensity for acceptance to similar institutions such as, but not limited to Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford. Primacy will be placed on an applicant's schools of preference and likelihood of acceptance. 4.a.2. This MARADMIN particularly solicits applicants interested in the following academic disciplines: strategy, security studies, geography, international affairs, economics, and public policy. Applicants interested in other strategy-related disciplines will also be considered. 4.a.3. Tuition. PHDP-S tuition and required academic fees are paid by Education Command (EDCOM) directly to the student's respective educational institution via third party billing. Optional student fees are the responsibility of the student; reimbursement for parking fees and other discretionary fees is not authorized. PHDP-S candidates are expected to be dissertation complete within three academic years. No more than one additional year to complete dissertation may be granted on a case-by-case basis by CG, EDCOM. Funding beyond four years may be borne by the individual student or require a waiver to be approved by CG, EDCOM. 4.a.4. Books. In accordance with reference (c) and (d), students will receive a $1,000 book stipend per academic year for up to two academic years while completing coursework. Students will receive a one-time $1,000 book stipend at the beginning of their dissertation phase. EDCOM will pay stipends directly to the student and in parallel with tuition payments. 4.b. PHDP-T 4.b.1. The purpose of the technical program is to select up to two officers per year to participate in a fully-funded doctoral program with a technical focus. This track selects officers to assess into a doctoral program at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) for approximately three years. Current assignment to NPS in a Master's program does not preclude eligibility for follow on assignment to the PHDP-T assuming all eligibility requirements have been met by established deadlines. Interested officers may visit NPS website at https:(slash)(slash)nps.edu/web/admissions/programs for details on the specified doctoral fields available; however, officers will indicate their desired course of study in the application process. Final selection will be determined based on the needs of the Marine Corps. Officers interested in doctoral programs outside of NPS may contact the PHDP-T POC for guidance. 4.b.2. Tuition. PHDP-T students assigned to Naval Postgraduate School are not subject to tuition and academic fees. Reimbursement for parking fees and other discretionary fees is not authorized. 4.b.3. Books. In accordance with reference (c) and (d), students will receive a $1,000 book stipend per academic year for up to two academic years while completing coursework.

On 26 August 2024, the Director for Manpower Management convened the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Marine Active and Reserve Attach\u00e9 (MARA) Selection Board to select Marines as primary candidates and identify alternates for duty with the Defense Attach\u00e9 Service (DAS) to report in FY26. The Secretary of Navy has approved the list of Marines herein and nominated them to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for final approval by the Secretary of Defense. 2. The board considered the packages of 46 qualified applicants and selected 13 officers as primary candidates. Demonstrated performance, Marine Air Ground Task Force experience, and the potential to operate effectively in a foreign, independent duty environment were among the factors considered in the selection process. 3. This MARADMIN specifically releases the Senior Defense Official/ Defense Attach\u00e9 (SDO/DATT) primary selected candidates. Ref (d) previously released all Non-SDO/DATT primary selected candidates. 4. Board results 4.a. Primary selections. Any changes from the originally advertised country list were based on requirements from DIA. 4.a.1. The board selected the following active duty officers for nomination to the DAS as SDO/DATTs with their slated assignments: Name MOS Country Johnson, Reese H. 0102 Dominican Republic Pettibon, Jonathon E. 0202 Papua New Guinea Zastoupil, Frank C. 7518 Ghana 5. Coordinating instructions 5.a. Primary selectees 5.a.1. Active duty acceptance of selection. Selectees shall accept or decline via email to their PMOS monitor no later than 31 January 2025. Selectees will copy their acceptance email to the HQMC Marine Attach\u00e9 Program Office at mara_application@usmc.mil to communicate acceptance of assignment and receive further guidance. 5.b. Alternate selectees. All alternates were identified in ref (d). No action is required on the part of Marines on the alternate list. In the event that a billet becomes vacant, Manpower Management will fleet-up an officer from the alternate list. PMOS monitors will directly contact any alternate selected as a fleet-up. 5.c. Declinations and deferrals 5.c.1 Declinations. Marines who decline assignment to a MARA billet must submit a declination in writing (AA form) via the first O6 in their chain of command addressed to HQMC via MMOA-3 NLT 31 January 2025. Marines who decline will be ineligible for future MARA billets, unless otherwise approved by the Director, Manpower Management. 5.c.2. Deferrals. Marines selected for assignment to a MARA billet who are unable to execute orders due to extraordinary circumstances may request a deferral. If approved, the Director, Manpower Management will defer the Marine to a future MARA selection panel. Primary selectees may submit a deferral request in writing (AA Form) via the first general officer in their chain of command addressed to HQMC via MMOA-3 NLT 31 January 2025. 5.d. Reporting and training 5.d.1. Selected Marines can expect Permanent Change of Station orders for training in the National Capital Region. Training start dates are dependent upon the assigned country and corresponding training requirements but can begin in Spring 2025. Selected officers with competing service requirements which could potentially delay their availability for training must notify their primary MOS monitor in their initial correspondence. 5.d.2. A limited portion of training during the Joint Military Attach\u00e9 School (JMAS) is available to the spouses of selected officers. Although spouse attendance is not required, it is highly recommended and does not incur any additional cost to the service member. Language training is available to the spouse for most billets at the request of the selected officer. In addition to training, a security clearance will be submitted for the spouse. 5.d.3. Spouses must be naturalized U.S. citizens prior to the service member attending JMAS. 5.d.4. Service members must complete a Counter Intelligence Polygraph examination prior to departing their current command. This will be coordinated through the selectee's parent command. 6.

Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (g), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected. This includes the physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section 10206 of ref (a). Ref (a) requires written notification to the officer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable. Commanding Officers must also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of administrative action. Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation. 4.b. Adverse Screening Process. Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or potentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10) removed the names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL). 5. Retirement and Transfer. Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion. An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component. 6. Accepting and Declining Promotion. Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted). To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade. Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline. 7. For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-1585 or DSN 278-1585. Email inquiries may be submitted via the Officer Promotions homepage at www.Marines.mil. Email address is officerpromotions@usmc.mil. 8. Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower Management Division.//"

If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10) removed the names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL). 7. Retirement and Transfer. Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion. An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component. 8. Accepting and Declining Promotion. Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 2 through 5 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted). To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade. Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline. 9. The following FY24 promotions are projected for March 2025 and are subject to change.

N. DOBSON/LTCOL/PP&O/EMAIL: ANDREW.N.DOBSON(AT)USMC.MIL// 1. The military occupational specialties detailed below were created and approved in support of the Strategist Management Occupational Field. 2. Background. In accordance with ref (A), Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies, and Operations submitted the below MOSs for approval. This change was thoroughly reviewed by the personnel, organization, and training (POT) pillars of the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, facilities, and cost working group. After review, the POT pillar leads unanimously recommended that Command General (CG) Training and Education Command (TECOM) create MOSs 0507, 0508, and 0509. These MOSs are contained in the FY25 MOS Manual. 3. MOS 0507, Strategic Planner (LtCol to Maj) FMOS, DC PP&O 3.a. Summary. Strategic Planners are developed through the combination of advanced intermediate level education and a utilization tour as an operational planner (0505). Their education and professional experience prepare these officers to continue on as advanced planners at the service level. Strategic Planners play a critical role in the development and implementation of service policy. These officers drive the strategic direction of the service by shaping force design, force development, and force employment. Strategic Planners will primarily reside at the service headquarters deputy commandant level; however, most Marine expeditionary forces and service components will also rate one 0507 as a senior planner. Select joint billets may be filled by a Strategic Planner based on available inventory. 3.b. Prerequisites. Advanced Intermediate Level Education (A-ILE) or Joint Advanced Warfighting School complete. 3.c. Requirements. Marine officers are awarded this MOS after 12 months in an 0505 billet or to the satisfaction of the commanding officer, whichever is shorter.

MOS 0508, Strategy Advisor (LtCol to Maj) FMOS, DC PP&O 4.a. Summary. Strategy Advisors are educated in the reciprocity of war and strategy, warfighting, and strategic interagency/coalition decision-making. They provide a complex level of analyses to assist senior leader decision making. Strategy Advisors represent the Marine Corps at the Combatant Command, Joint Staff, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) levels and higher. 0508 billets are listed as additional skills designators and maintained by DC PP&O and DC M&RA to ensure appropriate billets are staffed with Strategy Advisors. 4.b. Prerequisites. Selection by the Top Level School Board to a program that offers Advanced Strategy Courses as defined by DC PP&O and MCU. 4.c. Requirements. Complete one of the following Top Level School Advanced Strategy Courses (TLS-ASC): School of Advanced Military Studies, Advanced Strategic Leadership Studies Program; Army War College Advanced Strategic Art Program; Air Force Grand Strategy Seminar; Air Force Joint Warfighter Studies Seminar; Naval War College Advanced Strategist Program; Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies Strategic Thinkers Program. This MOS will be assigned to a Marine in an appropriate Service, Joint, or OSD planning billet by submitting a graduation certificate through the Marine's servicing IPAC. DC PP&O is the adjudication authority for Top Level School programs that result in this FMOS being awarded. 4. d. Duties. Strategy Advisors assist senior leader decision making to address complex problems through rigorous systemic thinking. They contextualize problems sets through lenses of past, current, and proposed strategies, wars, and eras of competition into their larger contexts. This analysis allows Strategy Advisors to delve into a problem set's myriad dimensions and offer detailed analyses. 5. MOS 0509, Marine Corps Strategist (LtCol to Maj) FMOS, DC PP&O 5.a. Summary. Marine Corps Strategists are strategic leaders that support senior military and civilian leader decision-making at service, combatant command, departmental, and national levels. They also understand and represent Marine Corps interests in the Joint and national strategy formulation processes, aid senior leaders in shaping national, defense, and military strategic guidance, and anticipate how strategic guidance will evolve in near, mid, and long-term. As uniformed officers with doctorate level education in national security-specific areas (e.g., strategy, international relations, military history, political science), these Marines provide senior leaders with advanced research, writing, conceptual framing, quantitative and qualitative data analysis, and planning for all forms of strategic engagement and communication. At all levels, they are well-suited to help generate national, defense, military, and service strategies designed to address current and future operational challenges. Marine Corps Strategists will reside at the Headquarters Marine Corps, combatant command, Joint Staff, and OSD levels. 0509 billets are listed as additional skills designators and maintained by DC PP&O and DC M&RA to ensure appropriate billets are staffed with Marine Corps Strategist. 5.b. Prerequisites. Meet eligibility requirements for the PhDP Strategist Track as laid out in ref (C). Officers must be selected for the PhDP Strategist program to be eligible for this MOS. 5.c. Requirements. PhDP Strategists must complete all university PhD program requirements to include defense, approval, and submission of their dissertation.

Effective as of 1 October 2024, this MARADMIN provides guidance to support Marine Corps Recruiting Command's (MCRC) Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 accession mission. This MARADMIN updates reference (a) and announces the FY25 Enlistment Option Programs (EOP) and the Enlistment Bonus Program (EBP). It also provides guidance for the FY25 Selected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR) Enlistment Bonus (EB) and Montgomery G.I. Bill - Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR) Kicker. The SMCR EB is authorized for either 10,000 or 6,000 dollars. The MGIB-SR Kicker amount varies up to 350 dollars a month for no more than 36 months. 2. Background 2a. The Marine Corps' objective is to maximize the number of fully trained, qualified, experienced, and deployable Marines in the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) over time and within any given personnel budget. As we progress towards an \"invest and retain\" model, it is critical to channel applicants into the right occupational fields to maximize our return on investment and increase Marines' propensity to serve beyond their initial contract. 2b. The Enlistment Incentive Program (EIP) provides recruiters with different options of enlistment programs available to entry-level applicants. The EIP supports the recruiting effort in acquiring the talent necessary to support the Force Design and FMF. These various programs ensure qualified applicants are aligned to a program that best fits their desires and talents. 2c. This EIP plan establishes the Program Enlisted For (PEF) and various Bonus PEF (BPEF) options available for MCRC to meet the annual accession requirement for the active component. 3. Active Component Enlistment Incentives 3a. Enlistment Option Program. The EOP offers applicants specific skill-group guarantees via PEFs. A PEF groups Primary Military Occupational Specialties (PMOS) by prerequisites. Every active component Marine Corps' applicant enlists within a PEF, not a specific MOS. An applicant's Statement of Understanding (SOU) outlines the specific PEF enlistment requirements. The PEF and PMOS distributions for FY25 are listed below. PEF MOS' that qualify for Targeted Investment Shipping Bonus (QT) are denoted with (*). 3.a.(1). AE (Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting) 7051 3.a.(2).

UT (Military Police and Corrections): 5811, 5831 3b. Enlistment Bonus Program. The EBP will be continually refined to enable the Marine Corps to remain competitive in the war for talent. The EBP facilitates the market expansion required to achieve annual shipping goals, skill channeling of talent into Force Design priorities, and to support service-level efforts to increase return on personnel investment. Bonuses may be adjusted during the FY as recruiting environment conditions require. The PEFs eligible for a bonus for FY25 are as follows: PEF BPEF Description Amount (1) BY QY Electronic Maintenance $15,000 (2) DG QQ Cyber and Crypto Operations $15,000 (3) Any QE $5,000 Shipping Bonus $5,000 (4) Any QF $10,000 Shipping Bonus $10,000 (5) Targeted QT Targeted Investment Shipping Bonus $9,000 (6) Any QV Plus 1 Year Targeted Investment Bonus $7,000 (7) Any QW Plus 2 Years Targeted Investment Bonus $15,000 4. Active Component Bonus Types 4.a. Skill bonuses are those bonuses listed in paragraph 3b. that are associated to a PEF (e.g. QY PEF is associated with the BY PEF). Applicants with either a QY or BY will be classified into one of the PMOSs under the BY PEF (Electronics Maintenance) listed in paragraph 3a. 4.b. Shipping bonuses are not associated with a particular PEF and can be applied to any PEFs. Applicants given the shipping bonus (QE) will first sign an SOU for a PEF listed in paragraph 3a. 4.c. The Targeted Investment Shipping Bonus (QT) is reserved for an applicant aligned to a targeted list of PEFs denoted by (*) in paragraph 3a. Applicants given this bonus will agree to begin their obligated service timeline following the awarding of a PMOS. This enhanced monetary incentive supports ongoing service-level efforts to increase return on personnel investment. 4.d. The Target Investment Plus 1/Plus 2 bonuses continue in FY25 to address contract inefficiencies by providing longer contract options. Targeted Investment Plus 1 (QV) and Targeted Investment Plus 2 (QW) bonuses require applicants to sign 1 or 2 additional years of service to their term of enlistment (TOE) in their contracts prior to shipping to recruit training. These bonuses will be paid out upon the Join (TTC 020) to the School of Infantry (SOI) and will be recouped at a prorated amount if a Marine does not complete their full TOE. 4.e. Active component applicants may receive only one enlistment bonus. 5. The following guidance is in support of administrators' authorization, obligation, and payment of active component enlistment bonuses. As outlined in reference (b), chapter 9, section 91201, the auto-generated enlistment bonus obligation type transaction code (TTC 245 000) and payment transactions (TTC 392 000) remain unchanged. 5a. For the QY and QQ bonuses, the first permanent duty station Join will automatically trigger (TTC 392 SEQ 000) and process the Enlistment Bonus (402 Remark). In the event the system generated (TTC 392 SEQ 000) transaction fails to process, the administrative Reporting Unit Code (RUC)/Installation Personnel Administration Center (IPAC) can report TTC 392 SEQ 000 in accordance with reference (b), chapter 9, and section 91201. 5b. For the QE, QF, QV, and QW bonuses, once the Enlistment Bonus Authorization (TTC 245 000) is reported and posted, the first SOI Join (TTC 020) will automatically trigger (TTC 392 000) and process the Enlistment Bonus (402 Remark). 5c. For the QT bonus, payment (TTC 392) will be generated once the Marine's administrative RUC/IPAC reports TTC 116 for extension of enlistment equal to the number of months spent at Basic Training, SOI, and PMOS \"A\" and or \"C\" School (if \"C\" school is required for awarding of the PMOS). 6. SMCR EB 6.a. Amounts. The SMCR EB amount is 10,000 dollars for those enlisting to \"required\" Quota Serial Numbers (QSN) and 6,000 dollars to those enlisting to the remaining QSNs. The QSN List defining \"required\" QSNs is coordinated between Reserve Affairs (RA), Marine Forces Reserve, and MCRC via separate correspondence. 6.b. Administrative Guidance 6.b.(1). MCRC G-3 is the only organization authorized to submit SMCR EB requests to RA Management (RA (RAM)). 6.b.(2). Requests will be submitted to RAM-1 via email at RAM-1@usmc.mil. 6.b.(3). The applicable bonus program code for the EB is Z7. 6.b.(4). Upon approval of the request, RA (RAM) will issue a Bonus Control Number (BCN) 6.b.(5). RA (RAM) will return the request with the assigned BCN and validation of signatures to MCRC G-3 via email. 6.b.(6). MCRC G-3 will enter the assigned BCN into the Marine Corps Recruiting Information Support System (MCRISS) and forward the approval to the appropriate Recruiting District. 6.b.(7).

BANKS/CAPT/UNIT: DC CDI TFSD QUANTICO VA/-/ TEL: DSN 278-6045/ TEL: COML (703) 784-6045// GENTEXT/REMARKS/ 1. Per ref (a), Total Force Structure Division (TFSD) has published the Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) through FY45 Tables of Organization and Equipment (T/O&E) and the Authorized Strength Report (ASR) data. The Total Force Structure Management System (TFSMS) was updated on 16 January 2025 and incorporates all approved changes to the Marine Corps force structure since the previously published T/O&E and ASR. This MARADMIN cancels ref (c) and will remain in effect until the publication of the July 2025 T/O&E and ASR. 2. The ASR produces the optimal manning allocation, ensuring the best distribution of personnel across the force, while attempting to meet all specified constraints. TFSD produces two ASRs. 2.a. The Target Strength ASR, which uses the end strength mandated by the NDAA to outline the total force structure across the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) is used for planning and programming. 2.a.(1). Per Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) direction, the following Manning Precedence Levels (MPLs) are in effect for the Target ASR: P2T2: Officer 100% Enlisted 100% Excepted: Officer 100% Enlisted 100% III MEF: Officer 98% Enlisted 99% Infantry Bn: Officer 96% Enlisted 98% Operating Force: Officer 94% Enlisted 96.5% Entry-Level Training: Officer 93% Enlisted 96% Priority: Officer 92% Enlisted 93% Pro-Share Officer 91% Enlisted 92% A list of major force structure changes incorporated within this ASR are available on the TFSD SharePoint website at https://usmc.sharepoint-mil.us/sites/DCCDI_TFSD/SitePages/ AUTHORIZED-STRENGTH-REPORT.aspx 2.b. The Average Strength ASR, used by the Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (DC M&RA) for staffing, averages strength over a 12-month period and better reflects on-hand inventory. The Average Strength is comparatively lower than the Target Strength ASR, resulting in fewer manning allocations. 2.b.(1). T/O manning allocations reflected in TFSMS are based on the Average Strength Manning Controls. 2.b.(2). Staffing, which refers to the portion of manning to be filled with assignable inventory, is determined by staffing precedence levels. These levels may differ from the MPLs as they are based on the current assignable inventory managed by DC M&RA. Staffing is not directly aligned with ASR manning due to personnel fluctuations. 3. TFSD maintains tools and resources to assist in reviewing total force structure and manning allocations. The tools are accessible on the TFSD SharePoint at https://usmc.sharepoint-mil.us/sites/DCCDI_TFSD/SitePages/Page.aspx 4. Updated T/O&Es are available on the TFSMS website at https:// tsms.mceits.usmc.mil. 4.a. Instructions for downloading current FY T/O&E report: After log-in, use the Search button to enter all or part of Unit Identification Code (UIC), unit name, Monitored Command Code or Reporting Unit Code and hit Enter on your keyboard. 4.b. Instructions for downloading planned or future FY T/O&E reports: After log-in, click on \"Reports\" link, then \"TFSMS Cognos Reports Portal.\" A unit's T/O&E is located in the \"Standard Reports (published, structure data current as of last ASR)\" folder. After entering the folder, click on \"Unit T/O&E Report\" and select the applicable FY and UIC. User must enable compatibility view settings for usmc.mil to select criteria for T/O&E report. 5. Readiness reporting. The Defense Readiness Reporting System- Marine Corps (DRRS-MC) automatically populates a unit's readiness report with force structure requirements from the current published FY TO&E resident in TFSMS. Units should validate the force structure requirements in their unit's readiness report using the current published FY25 T/O&E in TFSMS or use the T/O&E link in a unit's readiness report in DRRS-MC. 6. Initiatives that require Total Force (TF) Doctrine, Organization, Training/Education, Materiel, Leadership/Synchronization, Personnel, Facilities, & Cost Working Group (DOTMLPF-C WG) assessment in accordance with (IAW) ref (a) must submit the initiative topic to the DOTMLPF-C Secretariat no later than (NLT) 3 February 2025 for prioritization by Deputy Commandant, Combat Development and Integration (DC CD&I). 7.a. Force structure initiatives that may require assessment by the TF DOTMLPF-C WG include, but are not limited to: unit activations, deactivations, reorganizations, redesignations, relocations, and major MOS or occupational field changes. All initiatives must have three-star endorsement. The WG will assess each initiative for feasibility and supportability to inform future Force Structure decisions by DC CD&I or CMC. 7.b. Force structure initiatives submitted for consideration by the TF DOTMLPF-C WG must conform to CMC planning guidance. Initiatives should be traceable to the Force Design Annual Update and/or should represent formal output from a DC CDI chartered Integrated Planning Team, a standing Operational Advisory Group, experimentation Cross Functional Team output, or similar working group or advisory body. 7.c. Contact the TF DOTMLPF-C WG Secretariat for a determination regarding whether the initiative will require a TF DOTMLPF-C WG assessment. The secretariat will assist sponsors with preparation and pre-coordination of their initial brief. Supporting documentation required for an initial brief includes but is not limited to proposed T/O, Table of Equipment(T/E), and draft Mission Statements. All initiatives submitted for TF DOTMLPF-C WG assessment must be fully compensated IAW ref (a) chapter 5, para 3.c.(2). The initiative sponsor is responsible for identifying a structure offset(s) as part of the initiative. 8. Table of Organization and Equipment Change Request (TOECR) Policy. 8.a. All TOECRs submitted for inclusion in the July 2025 ASR must be submitted to TFSD NLT Wednesday, 21 May 2025. 8.b. All TOECR submissions must adhere to the applicable provisions of ref (a). 8.b.(1). All TOECRs must be endorsed by the MARFOR Commander (or applicable Lieutenant General) IAW ref (a), chapter 9. By Direction authority is not authorized. 8.b.(2). All TOECRs must be compensated IAW ref (a), chapter 9. 8.c. Additional amplifying information on TOECR submission is provided below. 8.c.(1). Units activated or reorganized based on Force Design decisions will not submit TOECRs until the action directed by MCBUL 5400 has been reported complete. 8.c.(2). TOECRs submitted on UICs lacking a current Mission Statement (3-year renewal requirement, per ref (a)) will be returned without action, unless a Mission Statement update TOECR is submitted concurrently or was previously submitted and is in processing. 8.c.(3). IAW ref (a), Military Manpower TOECRs will be programmed for the out-years and must align with future assignment planning cycles. TOECRs for the July 2025 ASR should be planned for execution no earlier than FY28. Requests for execution before FY28 will be returned without action. 8.c.(4). Civilian Manpower TOECRs: IAW ref (a), chapter 9, para 9.c., all term positions must be fully documented on the T/O for the full term duration. TOECRs that do not meet the criteria set forth by ref (a) will be returned without action. 8.c.(5). External assignments by Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). All TOECRs for external Marine assignments, including those to joint or other agencies and organizations, must include a signed MOA between the Marine Corps and the supported organization(s). According to ref (a), DC CD&I holds signature authority for executing these agreements. Before submitting the TOECR, the MOA should be coordinated, formatted, and staffed with DC CD&I (Attention: TFSD) for pre-coordination. After coordination, submit the final MOA package to DC CD&I via Enterprise Task Management Software Solution (ETMS2) for signature. Once fully executed, attach the MOA to the TOECR and submit it via TFSMS. 8.c.(6). TFSD maintains the title Navy Manpower Budget Submitting Office (BSO-27) and oversees all Navy Manpower in Support of Marine Corps (NMISOMC) missions, previously known as Blue in Support of Green (BISOG). This involves validating Navy structure and enlisted manning, aligning available Navy funding with USMC priorities, advocating for high-demand, low-density Navy personnel, coordinating staffing and managing billet adjustments. Coordination with BSO-27 is required for any TOCER that impacts or requires changes to NMISOMC structure. For questions or reconciliation regarding Navy manpower to include staffing, see Branch POCs in para 9.l. 9. TFSD POCs are: 9.a.

As announced by reference (a), the FY26 U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) promotion selection boards will convene on 19 February 2025, at 2008 Elliot Road, Marine Corps Base, Quantico, VA. The board will consider CWOs serving in an active status for promotion in Other Than Active Reserve (OTAR) and Active Reserve (AR) competitive categories by military occupational specialty (MOS). CWOs identified as Reserve Active-Status List (RASL) in reference (b) are in OTAR competitive categories. The OTAR selection boards will consider officers for promotion to the grades of CWO5, CWO4, and CWO3 if vacancies become available in the OTAR MOS competitive categories in these grades. CWOs identified as AR in reference (b) are in AR competitive categories. The AR selection boards will consider officers for promotion to the grades of CWO5, CWO4, and CWO3 if vacancies become available in the AR MOS competitive categories in the AR program in these grades. The AR MOS competitive categories are: A. Personnel Officer (MOS 0170) B. Aircraft Maintenance Engineer Officer (MOS 6004) C. Aviation Ordnance Officer (MOS 6502) 2. Promotion Board. The board will consider three categories of officers as specified by the yearly promotion plan: Above-Zone, In-Zone, and Below-Zone. Officers identified as RASL or AR in reference (b) are eligible for their respective board if, on the convening date of the board, the officers have continuously performed service on either the RASL or the Active-Duty List (or a combination of both lists) for a period of one year. However, officers whose established date for removal from the RASL is within 90 days after the date the board is convened will not be considered by the board. Officers whose lineal control number (LCN) precedes the senior officer In-Zone are defined as Above-Zone. Those Above- Zone officers who have not been previously considered are defined as \"Above-Zone, not previously considered.\" Officers in this status are considered by the board to be In-Zone. Officers may review reference (b) and their eligibility for the board on the internet at the officer promotion homepage. The senior and junior officers In-Zone (SR IZ and JR IZ) and the junior officer eligible Below- Zone (JR BZ) are as follows (Enclosures (1) and (2) of reference (b) apply): 2.a.

The Secretary of the Navy has approved a temporary departure from the running mate system for all ranks and competitive categories of reserve officer promotions. This departure will assist the Marine Corps in managing statutory grade strength for officers of all grades. Officers should carefully check their in-zone status, as the zones and opportunity may not mirror that of the active component. Additionally, reserve officers selected for promotion in FY26 will not be assigned a running mate. They will be promoted as announced in monthly promotion MARADMINS as vacancies allow. 4. Board Preparation Guidance. Officers are advised to review reference (a) for guidance regarding submission of information, auditing the Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) and Master Brief Sheet (MBS), and fitness reports and requests for non-selection prior to the convening date of the board. Officers are also reminded to review guidance in reference (a) regarding the Career Retirement Credit Report (CRCR) and Reserve Qualification Summary (RQS). OTAR officers are encouraged to submit a complete RQS as correspondence to the board to arrive not later than 10 calendar days (see paragraph 5.a.3.) before the date the board convenes. Officers may review reference (a) at the officer promotion homepage. The following guidance is provided: 5. Personal Responsibilities. Each officer is personally responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of their OMPF and MBS before the board convening date. 5.a. Officer Correspondence. All eligible officers may, if desired, submit correspondence to the President of the Board. The correspondence should include only those matters deemed important in the consideration of an officer's record. OMPF materials sent directly to the board president will not become part of an officer's OMPF. Although officers may submit any material they deem important, officers should contact CMC (MMPB-23) before submitting fitness reports and CMC (MMPB-22) for any other OMPF materials. This will ensure that an officer's OMPF is appropriately updated. The following guidelines apply: 5.a.1. Correspondence must be submitted under signed cover letter by the eligible officer with the material for the board's consideration listed as enclosures (a sample cover letter is available at the officer promotion homepage). Material submitted without a signed cover letter by the eligible officer will not be submitted to the board. 5.a.2. The cover letter must be addressed to the President, FY26 USMCR CWO Promotion Selection Board (see paragraph 8a for complete address), and signed with a pen by the eligible officer. 5.a.3. Pursuant to Title 10, U.S.C. Section 14101, eligible officers are personally responsible for ensuring CMC (MMPB-1) has received their personal correspondence to the President of the board NLT 2359 Eastern Standard Time (EST), 10 calendar days prior to the convene date of their respective board in order to be considered. Correspondence arriving after 2359 EST 10 calendar days before the board convene date WILL NOT be accepted or submitted to the board as per reference (g). All personal correspondence for the following boards must be received NLT 2359 EST on the due date annotated below: Board Component Convening Date Due Date FY26 CWO Reserve 19 Feb 2025 08 Feb 2025 5.b. Communications or memorandums of recommendation from other parties on behalf of officers eligible for consideration will not be provided to the board unless forwarded as an enclosure to a signed memorandum to the board from the officer being considered IAW paragraphs 5.a.1-3 of this MARADMIN. 6.

DIXON/MAJ/CMC (MPE)/TEL: COM 703-784-6164/ TEL: DSN 278/EMAIL: SARA.DIXON@USMC.MIL// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. In accordance with Public Law 98-144 (1983), the third Monday of January is designated as a federal holiday to honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. This year, we commemorate his life and achievements on Monday, January 20, 2025. In observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, this year's theme, \"Excellence in Action,\" honors the legacy of nonviolent demonstrators who fought to address the injustices faced by Black Americans and other minorities. 2. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 marked a pivotal moment in the fight against racial discrimination and segregation, with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. calling it a \"second emancipation.\" The Act desegregated public facilities, schools, and addressed discriminatory voting practices, while prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The civil rights movement faced violent opposition, epitomized by the brutal attack on activists during the 1965 \"Bloody Sunday\" march in Selma, Alabama. This tragic event galvanized the nation in its fight against racial injustice. Dr. King's leadership, culminating in the successful 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march and subsequent passage of the Voting Rights Act and Fair Housing Act, is symbolized in this year's commemorative poster, which honors his enduring commitment to equality and justice. The poster is found on the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute website: https://www.deomi.mil/ Special-Observances/#martin-luther-king-jr-birthday. 3. In observance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, commanders are encouraged to honor his legacy by organizing programs and activities that celebrate his contributions. Participation in local community events and unit-level observances is strongly encouraged, fostering reflection on the ideals Dr. King championed and their continued significance to our mission and values. 4.

Per references (a) and (b), Suicide Prevention is a priority for the Department of Defense (DoD), the United States Marine Corps, and the Integrated Primary Prevention Workforce. Lethal Means Safety (LMS) is an effective and evidence-based method for saving lives. Reducing access to lethal means during times of crisis reduces the risk of suicide and other tragic outcomes. Defense Suicide Prevention Office (DSPO) contracted CNA (formerly Center for Naval Analyses) to conduct studies of LMS within DoD military services. 2. To ensure future LMS initiatives are informed by Marines' needs and perspectives, Marine and Family Programs Division (MF) is coordinating with CNA to conduct an LMS survey of Marines. The survey explores Marines' awareness of current LMS programs, preferences for safety devices and storage locations, and considerations for LMS messaging specific to Marine Corps culture. 3. This survey is sponsored by DSPO and is administered by CNA. DSPO and MF are exploring how LMS outreach efforts are implemented and whether these efforts are reaching Marines. 4. The survey is currently open and closes on 31 January 2025. Participation is voluntary and the survey should take less than 15 minutes. No names, contact information, or any other personally identifiable information will be collected in the survey. 5. Marines interested in participating can access the survey at https:(slash)(slash)cnaorg.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_38L0FHrDBa BpuES. 6.

This MARADMIN publishes the Marine Corps policy on Special Compensation for Assistance with Activities of Daily Living (SCAADL) as outlined in references (a) through (g). SCAADL is an authorized compensation paid to the service member that offsets the economic burden borne by a primary caregiver providing nonmedical care, support, and assistance for the member. SCAADL is taxable income for the service member. 2. Responsibilities. Deputy Commandant for Manpower & Reserve Affairs, Manpower Plans and Policy Division, Military Manpower Policy Branch is the Office of Primary Responsibility with Wounded Warrior Regiment as Office of Coordinating Responsibility. 3. Program Guidance 3.a. Effective 31 August 2011, service members of a regular or reserve component must meet the below criteria to receive SCAADL: 3.a(1) Have incurred or aggravated a permanent catastrophic illness or injury in the line of duty. 3.a(2) Be certified by a licensed Department of Defense (DoD) or Veterans Affairs (VA) physician to have a permanent catastrophic injury or illness and need assistance from another person to perform the personal functions required in everyday living or require constant supervision and, in the absence of such assistance, would require hospitalization, nursing home, or institutional care. 3.a(3) Be an outpatient. 3.a(4) Have a designated primary caregiver who assists with at least one of the following activities of daily living (ADL) due to the service member's: 3.a(4)(a) Inability to dress or undress himself/herself. 3.a(4)(b) Inability to bathe or groom to keep self-clean and presentable. 3.a(4)(c) Frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid (this will not include the adjustment of appliances which uninjured persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.). 3.a(4)(d) Inability to independently use the toilet or attend to toileting without assistance or maintain perineal hygiene. 3.a(4)(e) Inability to feed himself/herself through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness or inability to swallow. 3.a(4)(f) Difficulty with mobility (inability to transfer safely from bed to chair, safely position himself/herself in bed, or walk safely on various surfaces). 3.a(4)(g) Incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the service member from hazards or dangers incident to his or her daily environment. 3.a(4)(h) Requires supervision or assistance as a result of seizures. 3.a(4)(i) Difficulty with planning and organizing. 3.a(4)(j) Difficulty with sleep regulation. 3.a(4)(k) Requires assistance or supervision due to delusions or hallucinations. 3.a(4)(l) Difficulty with recent memory. 3.a(4)(m) Self-regulation (requires supervision or assistance due to aggressive or combative behavior toward self or others or verbally disruptive). 3.b. In addition to meeting the above criteria, the service member must also meet all the following criteria: 3.b(1) Requires continual medical management or is at high risk for personal safety; 3.b(2) Without caregiver support providing personal care services or assistance with activities of everyday living, would require hospitalization, a nursing home, or other institutional care; and 3.b(3) Not be provided concurrent services by another entity. 4. Eligibility for SCAADL requires the service member to be in an outpatient status and no longer determined to be an inpatient at a military treatment facility, Department of VA Medical Center, civilian hospital, nursing home, or other residential institutional care. Although individuals may be temporarily placed in an inpatient status during the month for tests, examinations, or treatment, they remain eligible for the full monthly SCAADL payment provided they are in an outpatient status the majority of the time within a 30-day period. (i.e., 16 days or more in a 30-day period). 5. If a member meets all eligibility requirements stated above, the effective date of entitlement of SCAADL will be the date a licensed DoD or VA physician certifies the member meets the criteria for special compensation (item 6k of the Department of Defense Form (DD Form) 2948 - Application for Special Compensation for Assistance with Activities of Daily Living (SCAADL)). 5.a. Service members may not designate another active-duty military member or a reservist on active-duty orders as their primary caregiver. 5.b. SCAADL may not be paid to a qualified member if any other federal agency is providing outpatient or in-home services to assist with ADL or supervision to avoid harm to self or others. 5.c. SCAADL may not be paid to a qualified member if their primary caregiver is receiving a monthly caregiver stipend from the Department of VA under the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010. 5.d. Service members who qualify for and accept in-home assistance with ADL (custodial care) paid with supplemental health care program funds provided by a Tricare-authorized Home Health Agency (HHA) are not eligible for SCAADL. 5.d(1) If a service member is returned to duty through rehabilitation, or is found fit by the physical evaluation board, or otherwise returned to duty status as unfit but retained on active duty, the service member will be removed from the SCAADL Program effective the month prior to the approval to return to full duty. 5.d(2) Service members who qualify for SCAADL shall have the qualifying payments continue until the earliest date of the following conditions: 5.d(2)(a) The last day of the month 90 days after separation or retirement of the member (example: 1 February 2025 separation date plus 90 days equals 1 May 2025. The member will receive services until the end of the month, 31 May 2025). 5.d(2)(b) The last day of the month during which a member dies. 5.d(2)(c) The last day of the month during which the member is determined to be no longer afflicted with the catastrophic injury or illness. The relevant month is the month during which the member becomes no longer afflicted with a catastrophic illness or injury. A service member is not entitled to SCAADL if the member is no longer afflicted with a catastrophic illness or injury but has not met with a physician. 5.d(2)(d) The last day of the month preceding the month during which the member begins receiving compensation under the VA Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010. 6. The Commanding Officer (CO), Wounded Warrior Regiment (WWR) will ensure all SCAADL applications are independently reviewed by a licensed DoD or VA physician other than the physician who certified the DD form 2948. 7. Determination of the amount of monthly SCAADL compensation. 7.a. The WRR Pay and Entitlement Section will certify SCAADL entitlements via unit diary and will ensure the amounts are computed properly based on the entitlement certification. 7.b. The amount of compensation for each service member will be based on a three-tier system that, in turn, is based upon a clinical determination of the number of ADL needs of the service members and the hours, up to 40 hours per week, required by a caregiver to perform each ADL or significant mental health and/or behavior impairment of the service member requiring continuous supervision. A licensed DoD or VA physician will utilize DD form 2948 to determine the member's level of dependency based on the degree to which the member is unable to perform one or more activities of daily living or the degree to which the member is in need of supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury. If the service member's attending physician is a civilian provider not affiliated with DoD or VA, arrangements will be made to have a licensed DoD or VA physician review the case and complete the certification process. Based on the clinical evaluation and score, the member will be rated as follows: 7.b(1) High Tier: Service members who score 21 or higher will be presumed to need a full-time caregiver, one who provides 40 hours of personal care services per week. 7.b(2) Medium Tier: Service members who score 13-20 will be presumed to require 25 hours per week of caregiver assistance. 7.b(3) Low Tier: Service members who score 1-12 will be presumed to require 10 hours per week of caregiver assistance. 8. The CO, WWR has delegated the initial SCAADL adjudication to the supervisor, Pay and Entitlements and their deputy. 9. Processes for Requests and Appeals 9.a. Requests for SCAADL payment must include the completed DD form 2948 and statement of understanding with the ADL, supervision, and scoring guide completed by a licensed DoD or VA physician. Requests will be forwarded, via the service member's chain of command, to the CO, WWR (Attn: Pay and Entitlements), 1998 Hill Avenue, Marine Corps Base, Quantico, VA 22134-5001, for approval and payment. Requests can also be forwarded via e-mail to the WWR organizational mailbox: t-sgli@usmc.mil. The DD form 2948, and the Statement of Understanding may be retrieved from www.woundedwarrior.marines.mil. To the greatest extent possible, all responsible parties should complete the SCAADL application (DD form 2948) within 30 days from the initial licensed DoD or VA physician certifying eligibility date. 9.b. Appeals of an initial determination that a service member is not eligible for SCAADL will be submitted to the CO, WWR (Attn: Pay and Entitlements). Ensure all medical reviews and opinions are included. The service member may also appeal their tier level, start date, and scoring. Following a thorough review and development of a medical advisory opinion by the Regimental Surgeon, Command Advisor, and Regimental Nurse, the CO will review the appeal to determine SCAADL entitlement. 10. Recertification and Procedures 10.a. At a minimum, recertification for SCAADL is required every 180 days. A new DD form 2948 must be completed by a licensed DoD or VA physician and forwarded to the CO, WWR for approval and payment. The reevaluation and recertification shall be consistent with the certification process used to establish initial SCAADL eligibility. 10.b. Service member eligibility for SCAADL shall be continuously evaluated to ensure eligibility remains intact. If a service member's eligibility changes prior to the 180-day recertification, (i.e., change of location, improvement/regression in medical condition) the reevaluation and recertification paperwork will be submitted at that time. 10.c. The Service member's recovery team, to include the primary care manager, recovery care coordinator, non-medical case managers, and unit leadership, shall ensure that whenever any marked changes in the service member's medical condition (which may warrant an increase or decrease in the level of caregiver support required) are identified, the member is referred to a licensed DoD or VA physician for a reevaluation. 10.d. Service members will also be required to recertify upon release from a hospital stay of 16 days or more in a 30-day period, a change in location, or if their medical condition changes. 10.e. The WWR Pay and Entitlement Section will notify service members via separate correspondence 30 and 60 days prior of their termination date of their requirement to recertify. If a service member fails to recertify their SCAADL, the entitlement will be terminated at the end of the month they are required to recertify. 11. Definitions 11.a. ADL. Feeding (including special diets), dressing and sheltering; personal hygiene services; observation and general monitoring; bowel training or management (unless abnormalities in bowel function are of a severity to result in a need for medical or surgical intervention in the absence of \"skilled services\"); safety precautions; general preventive procedures (such as turning to prevent bedsores); passive exercise; transportation; and other such elements of personal care that can reasonably be performed by an untrained adult with minimal instruction or supervision. ADL may also be referred to as \"essentials of daily living\" as defined in part 199.2(b) of title 32, code of federal regulations.

Institutional care in conjunction with in and out (ambulatory) surgery is not included within the meaning of inpatient, whether an inpatient number or designation is made by the hospital or other institution. If the patient has been received at the hospital, but death occurs before the actual admission occurs, an inpatient admission exists as if the patient had lived and had been formally admitted. 11.d.

Per references (a) and (b), Suicide Prevention is a priority for the Department of Defense (DoD), the United States Marine Corps, and the Integrated Primary Prevention Workforce. Lethal Means Safety (LMS) is an effective and evidence-based method for saving lives. Reducing access to lethal means during times of crisis reduces the risk of suicide and other tragic outcomes. Defense Suicide Prevention Office (DSPO) contracted CNA (formerly Center for Naval Analyses) to conduct studies of LMS within DoD military services. 2. To ensure future LMS initiatives are informed by Marines' needs and perspectives, Marine and Family Programs Division (MF) is coordinating with CNA to conduct an LMS survey of Marines. The survey explores Marines' awareness of current LMS programs, preferences for safety devices and storage locations, and considerations for LMS messaging specific to Marine Corps culture. 3. This survey is sponsored by DSPO and is administered by CNA. DSPO and MF are exploring how LMS outreach efforts are implemented and whether these efforts are reaching Marines. 4. The survey closes on [DATE]. Participation is voluntary and the survey should take less than 15 minutes. No names, contact information, or any other personally identifiable information will be collected in the survey. 5. Marines interested in participating can access the survey at https:(slash)(slash)[PLACEHOLDER LINK TO QUALTRICS SURVEY] 6. This MARADMIN is cancelled 31 October 2025. 7.

Per reference (a), in accordance with the CMC Force Design 2030 Annual Update from June 2023, the Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and Integration (DC CD&I) and Deputy Commandant for Aviation (DCA) were tasked to institutionalize the Multifunction Air Operations Center (MAOC) for the service through the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Cost (DOTMLPF-C) process. In August of 2024, the 39th Commandant provided a letter to the Deputy Commandant for Aviation with additional guidance for all things pertaining to Marine aviation. From this letter, a specific task was issued to continue implementation of MAOC in coordination with adjacent headquarters stakeholders. In accordance with CMC direction and guidance, DCA established a MAOC Transition Task Force (TTF) Charter to manage the associated DOTMLPF-C initiatives required to institutionalize MAOC for the service. Initiative one, has been established as the merger of the 7236 and 7242 enlisted Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) as well as the 7208 and 7210 officer MOS. Initiative two, has been established as the reorganization of the Marine Air Control Group (MACG) in support the MAOC concept in which the MOS merger sets conditions to execute the MACG reorganization. In October 2024, initiative one underwent a DOTMLPF-C working group analysis resulting in a unanimous low-risk, supportable assessment by the DOTMLPF-C pillars, reference (d). The end state is to modernize the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS) for the service through the merger of air support and air defense MOSs to create common multifunction air command and control (AC2) Marines in support of the MAOC. Combining these fields seeks to provide the MAGTF with gains in efficiency via better trained and more capable AC2 Marines able to support all functions of aviation while enabling the service to retain talent IAW reference (b). 2. In coordination with Manpower & Reserve Affairs (M&RA), Training and Education Command (TECOM), and Combat Development and Integration (CD&I), the below changes are reflected in the FY26 MOS Manual. 3. Marines with the PMOS 7236 and 7242 will be recoded to PMOS 7240 (Tactical Air Control Operator) on 1 October 2025. Marines with the PMOS 7208 and 7210 will be recoded to PMOS 7209 (Air Command and Control Officer) on 1 October 2025. The Table of Organization and Equipment Change Request (TOECR) was approved and is reflected in the January 2025 ASR. 4. M&RA (MMIB) will report unit diary entries to convert active component Marines with PMOS 7236 or 7242 to PMOS 7240, and PMOS 7208 or 7210 to PMOS 7209. These Marines will be identified in a reclassification spreadsheet provided by the (72XX) Occupational Field Sponsor to MMIB. Reserve Affairs Management will convert reserve component Marines with PMOS 7236 or 7242 to PMOS 7240, and PMOS 7208 or 7210 to PMOS 7209. No action is required by the individual Marine. 5. Training 5.a. Entry Level Training (ELT) 5.a.1. NLT 1 October 2025, all prospective 7240 and 7209 PMOS ELT students will attend either the enlisted Tactical Air Control Operator Course M0972B1 or Air Command and Control Officer Course M096871. 5.b. Legacy 7236, 7242, 7208, and 7210 PMOS Training 5.b.1. All ELT students that attend ELT training in CY25 under legacy course identification codes for the Tactical Air Defense Controller Course M0972P1, Air Support Operations Operator Course M0967L1, Air Support Control Officers Course M09T0A1, and Air Defense Control Officer Course M0972M1 will have completed MAOC pilot course curriculum meeting new PMOS training requirements. These Marines will be granted their new PMOS on 1 October 2025 and assigned to duty stations based on the current ASR. 5.b.2. All 7236 and 7242 Marines holding the rank of Gunnery Sergeant or above will be exempt from any additional training requirements to be granted the PMOS of 7240. All 7236 and 7242 Marines holding a qualification of Crew Chief or above will be exempt from any additional training requirements to be granted the PMOS of 7240. All 7208 and 7210 Marines holding a qualification of Senior Air Director or above will be exempt from any additional training requirements to be granted the PMOS of 7209. All other Marines not meeting these requirements will be tracked by a draw case code and be required to complete local unit transition training to remove the draw case code from their new PMOS designation. 5.b.3. Local unit transition training will be accomplished via a combination of contracted Mobile Training Teams (MTT) and unit Weapons and Tactics Instructors that will provide a Train-the-Trainer (T3) period of instruction to establish an initial uniformed cadre of trainers at each applicable unit. Once trained, uniformed trainers at each unit will continue to provide the requisite transition training to those Marines with a draw case code. A certificate of transition training completion will be generated and endorsed by the local unit commander and provided to each trained Marine for their record as the method to track transition training completion. Those local units will produce training rosters of no less than 20 Marines with their associated training certificates, to be routed and consolidated at the O-6 level and submitted to the Occupational Field Sponsors (POC 1, 2, and 3) for reconciliation and submission for removal of the draw case code, signaling completion of transition training. The deadline to complete and submit record of transition training completion is one year from the establishment of local unit trainer cadre by the MTT and/or one year from a Marine designated with a draw case code reporting to an affected unit with trained cadre. 6. The above changes are effective as of release of this message and are reflected in the FY26 update to reference (C). 7. This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force. 8. Any questions should be directed to POC 1, 2, or 3 as indicated above. 9. Release authorized by LtGen Bradford J. Gering, Deputy Commandant for Aviation.//"

Under the provisions of section 578 of ref (a) and ref (c), the Secretary of the Navy, acting for the President of the United States, hereby authorizes the promotion of the following named regular officer(s) as indicated, to the permanent grade of Chief Warrant Officer Five (CWO5) through Chief Warrant Officer Three (CWO3). Rank, pay, and allowances are effective from 1 June 2025. Name Grade MCC Anthony D. Siani CWO5 1EM Matthew H. Hutcheson CWO4 070 David W. Lee CWO4 142 Bruce F. Machado CWO4 914 Patrick C.

Per refs (b) and (h), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected. This includes the physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section 10206 of ref (a). Ref (a) requires written notification to the officer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable. Commanding Officers must also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of administrative action. Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation. 6.b. Adverse Screening Process. Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or potentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10) removed the names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL). 7. Retirement and Transfer. Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion. An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component. 8. Accepting and Declining Promotion. Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 2 through 5 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted). To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade. Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline. 9. The following FY25 promotions are projected for July 2025 and are subject to change. Promotions from the remaining FY25 boards will be promulgated based on vacancy determination and senate confirmation. Senior Officer Sel Junior Officer Sel Col (R) J. A. Tempone, Jr. 30 A. L.
