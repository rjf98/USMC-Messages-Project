REF B IS MCO 5100.29C w/ CH-2, VOLUMES 1, 2 AND 5, THE \nMARINE CORPS SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.//\nPOC1/T. HINMAN/GS-14/SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH BRACH HEAD/\nCMC SAFETY DIVISION/703-571-4599/TAMI.HINMAN@USMC.MIL//\nPOC2/S. CURTIS/GS-13/SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH MANAGER/\nCMC SAFETY DIVISION/703-571-4558/SHAWN.CURTIS@USMC.MIL//\nGENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  Whether operational or recreational, the Marine\nCorps remains steadfast in its commitment to a culture of mitigating \nrisk.  This especially holds true during the 101 Critical Days of \nSummer (CDS) which occurs Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day \n(24 May to 1 September 2025).  \n2.  Historically during this period, the Marine Corps loses more \nMarines to preventable off-duty recreational mishaps than any other \ntime of the year as leisure travel and outdoor high-risk activities \nsurge.  \n3.  Over the past 5 summers, 59 Marines died in off-duty \nrecreational mishaps with private motor vehicles (26), motorcycles\n(15), and water-related outings (9) being the leading activities.\n4.  As encouraged in reference (a), personnel must properly prepare\nthemselves when planning for and conducting summertime activities \nwith known elements of risk.  Understanding hazards and taking \naction to mitigate and manage risk is a personal endeavor.  \nAccepting or tolerating unnecessary and uncalculated risk endangers\nrisk-takers, innocent bystanders, first responders, and those who\nanswer the call for help.  Equally important, preventable off-duty\nmishaps have added consequences by needlessly contributing to strain\non our resources and unquestionable stress on our families, friends,\nand co-workers.\n5.  Off-duty risk mitigation training prior to commencement of the \nCDS period and during the permanent change of station onboarding \nprocess has proven to be an effective means for minimizing the \nlikelihood of preventable off-duty mishaps. \n6.  In support of this cause and per reference (b), all Marines and\nSailors shall receive documented summer safety briefings prior to\neach extended holiday liberty.  Recommended key topics include\nprivate motor vehicle and motorcycle operation, water excursions, \nresponsible alcohol consumption, heat illness and injury prevention, \ninclement weather conditions, barbecue and camp fires, fireworks, \ncamping, trekking, and any other recreational off-duty activity that \nincreases the probability of a mishap. \n7.  Commanders and leaders at all ranks have a profound impact on\nour readiness by inspiring individual and unit risk mitigation \nmeasures and reinforcing established safety protocols.  I encourage\nall leaders to be creative when conducting CDS training by choosing\na location that complements the significance of summertime safety and\nits underlying message.  Both the Naval Safety Command \n(https://navalsafetycommand.navy.mil/Off-Duty/101-CDOS/) and your \nlocal installation safety office serve as great resources for summer \nsafety products and information. \n8.  By cultivating a safety culture in which calculating and managing \nrisk is part of the decision-making process, we enhance readiness \nand build strong relationships of trust through demonstrating a \ngenuine concern for the welfare of our warfighting team.  Having the\ncourage to speak up and take action to break the cycle of events \nthat leads to a preventable loss aligns with our warrior ethos and \nis a trait each of us must strive to exemplify.\n9.  This summer, I encourage you to have fun with family and friends, \nwhile also keeping safety and risk management an integral part of \nyour decision-making, on and off duty.  By working together, sharing \nknowledge, and adhering to established safety protocols, we can \nmitigate risks and ensure a safe and successful summer.\n10.  Release authorized by Lieutenant General Paul J. Rock, Jr., \nDirector, Marine Corps Staff.//"

In accordance with references (a) and (b), this \nMARADMIN establishes procedures for the FY27 Regular Colonel \nContinuation board and administration actions of selected officers. \nThe primary purpose of this continuation process is to retain \ncompetent and effective commissioned officers through the selective \ncontinuation process as a means of satisfying the needs and critical \nskill requirements of the Marine Corps. To achieve this, the Colonel \nContinuation board will be conducted separately and apart from the \nBrigadier General Promotion Selection Board, allowing for results of \nColonel Continuation to be released by MMSR-2(O) prior to the \nresults of that promotion board.  Colonels selected for continuation\nremain eligible for selection for Brigadier General.  \n1.a. Convening date and location.  The FY27 Regular Colonel \nContinuation board will be held at 2008 Elliot Road, Quantico, VA \n22134 on 10 July 2025.\n2.  Eligibility.  Regular colonels with mandatory retirement dates \n(MRD) between 1 January 2026 and 31 December 2027 will be considered \nfor continuation of active-duty service. Selected officers will be \noffered the opportunity to remain on active duty as specified in \nreferences (a) through (d).  Colonels unsure of their MRD are \nencouraged to contact their local administrative center to confirm \nit using the MCTFS RT01 screen.\n3.  Board Correspondence.  Officers may submit correspondence to the \nPresident of the Board via Boards and Surveys at \nhttps://www2.manpower.usmc.mil/application_cac/ or via the MMSR \norganizational mailbox at smb_manpower_mmsr20@usmc.mil. \nInformation provided to the Continuation Board will not be available \nto any other board. \n3.a. Board Correspondence Deadline.  Eligible officers are \npersonally responsible for ensuring CMC (MMSR-2(O)) has received \ntheir correspondence to the President of the Board NLT 2359 Eastern \nStandard Time (EST) on 29 June 2025 (10 calendar days prior to the \nboard convene date). \n3.b. Board Correspondence Format.  Letters to the board should be \naddressed to \u201cPresident, FY27 USMC Regular Colonel Continuation \nBoard.\u201d  Correspondence with enclosures must be submitted under a \nsigned cover letter by the eligible officer, with the material for \nthe board\u2019s consideration listed as enclosures.   Correspondence \nfrom the eligible officer must be signed either with a pen or with a \nCAC digital signature. \n3.c. Eligible officers are encouraged to declare their intent to \naccept continuation if selected to the President of the Board via \nBoard Correspondence.  However, this declaration will not be \nbinding; once the board results are approved, every \nofficer selected will have the opportunity to accept or decline \ncontinuation.\n4.  Personal responsibilities.  Each officer is personally \nresponsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of their \nOfficial Military Personnel File (OMPF) and Master Brief Sheet (MBS) \nbefore the date the board convenes.  As outlined in reference (e), \nOMPF-Records Management Application (O-RMA) is the most expeditious \nmeans of obtaining and viewing the OMPF and MBS. Officers can access \nthe O-RMA home page to view their record at:  \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www4.manpower.usmc.mil/orma/#/.\n5. Notification of Selection for continuation  \n5.a. Regular colonels selected for continuation will receive a \nselection notification upon logging in to Marine Online (MOL).  This \nnotification will formally announce their selection and may be \nfollowed up with a telephonic notification as a secondary measure. \nOfficers are encouraged to ensure their current cell phone number is\nincluded in their personal contact information within Marine Online \nto facilitate potential telephonic contact.  \n5.b. Selected colonels must communicate their intent to accept or \ndecline the continuation offer to their monitor and MMSR-2(O) via \nemail at smb_manpower_mmsr20@usmc.mil within 30 days of \nnotification.  The deadline for this response is 30 calendar days \nfrom the date the selection notification is displayed on MOL. \nFailure to respond within this timeframe will result in the \npresumption of declination.\n6.  Accepting continuation\n6.a. In accordance with reference (d), officers accepting \ncontinuation will be continued for 3 years for a total of 33 years \nof active commissioned service, or until the age of 62, whichever is \nearlier. \n6.b. Officers who accept continuation will also incur a 2-year \nservice obligation from the date the board is approved. This \nobligation will run concurrently with any other existing service \nobligation.  \n6.c. Acceptance of continuation makes officers eligible for future \npromotion opportunities, and, subject to existing orders and \npolicies, permanent change of station orders, permanent change of \nassignment orders, or an extension of current orders.\n7.  Declining continuation. Officers declining continuation shall \ninform MMSR-2(O) no later than 30 days from notification of \nselection via email to smb_manpower_mmsr20@usmc.mil. Colonels who \ndecline continuation will retain their current MRD.  \n8.  Post-9/11 GI Bill Transfer of Education Benefits (TEB).  Per \nreference (f), if an individual has been approved to TEB and fails \nto complete the associated service obligation, the amount of any \ntransferred entitlement that is used as of the date of such failure \nwill be treated as an overpayment of educational assistance and will \nbe subject to collection by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA).  \nFor additional questions regarding TEB benefits, contact MMOA-3 at\nsmb_manpower_officer_programs@usmc.mil.\n9.  Contact information. Eligible officers should contact their \ncareer counselor through MMOA to address any concerns about \ncontinuation.  \n9.a.

Though each fought with \nindividual determination, they are forever united as a band of\nbrothers and sisters \u2014 an elite company of warriors who upheld the\nhighest traditions of honor, courage, and commitment.\n3.  On this Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women, across\nall generations, who made the ultimate sacrifice.  Their actions set\nthe standard for selflessness and valor. Let us take time to reflect\non the courage of all who served \u2014 Marines, Sailors, Soldiers, \nAirmen, Guardians, and Coast Guardsmen \u2014 who gave their lives for \nthe Nation.\n4.  Stay safe and look out for one another this holiday weekend. You\nare a living tribute to our fallen \u2014 carry their memory forward, and\nreturn ready to continue the mission.\n5.  Semper Fidelis, Eric M. Smith, General, U.S. Marine Corps,\nCommandant of the Marine Corps.//"

This message provides acquisition \nguidance and is intended to ensure proper administrative control \nof funds for the procurement of non-tactical vehicles (NTVs) and \nequipment to avoid Anti Deficiency Act (ADA) violations.\n2.  Background.  Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics \n(DC I&L) Facilities Division (LF), oversees the centralized \nprocurement of NTVs funded by Procurement, Marine Corps (PMC) \nappropriations (references (e) and (f)).  This program is designed \nto minimize risk for the Marine Corps and ensure transparency in the \nallocation and use of NTVs and equipment as mandated by regulations. \nAny acquisition of equipment that could potentially be classified as\nan NTV (see definitions below), must be referred to a fleet manager \nwith delegated NTV program authority before proceeding with \nprocurement actions.\n3.  Definitions.  NTVs, previously known as Garrison Mobile \nEquipment  (GME), include government-owned, leased, and controlled \ncommercial vehicles, trailers, material handling and engineering \nequipment designed to transport passengers or cargo for \nadministrative operational support in a garrison environment.  \nAll DoD vehicles that are designed to operate safely on improved \nroadways, such as sedans, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), carryalls, \nvans, trucks, buses, and low-speed vehicles are considered NTVs.  \nAn NTV is a self-propelled wheeled conveyance that does not operate\non rails and is designed to be operated safely on roadways \nprincipally for the administrative movement of property or \npassengers.  NTVs do not include vehicles designed or used for \nmilitary field training, combat operations, tactical purposes, or\nstrictly off-road terrain (references (d) and (f)).  NTVs are \ndivided into four main categories:\n3.A. Commercial Passenger Vehicles (CPV).  CPVs are sedans, SUVs, \ncarryalls, vans, low-speed vehicles, and buses of various sizes that\nare designed to be operated safely on improved roadways.\n3.B. Commercial Cargo Vehicles (CCV).  CCVs are general purpose \nvehicles such as light/medium/heavy duty cargo trucks, special duty\ntrucks, certain firefighting apparatus, refuse collection trucks, \nfuel/water tanker trucks, and most types of trailers designed to \ntransport cargo, when connected to CPVs and CCVs, over improved \nroadways.\n3.C. Material Handling Equipment (MHE).  MHE is mobile commercial\nequipment used to move, protect, store, or control material and \ncontainers throughout the warehousing, distribution, consumption, \nand disposal activities of material handling operations.  This \nencompasses a broad range of mobile equipment designed to \nfacilitate the efficient and effective handling of materials and \ncontainers. Examples of NTV MHE includes equipment such as \nforklifts, mobile cranes, platform trucks, and rough terrain \ncontainer handlers.\n3.D. Garrison Mobile Engineer Equipment (GMEE).  GMEE is \ncommercial construction and engineering equipment such as \ngraders, backhoes, cranes, tracked vehicles, and other \nconstruction equipment.  They support garrison facilities and \nroad maintenance, force protection and airfield operations.\n4.  Responsibilities.      \n4.A. DC I&L (LF) is responsible for issuing guidance, \ncentralized NTV acquisition, approving and monitoring \nequipment allowances, ensuring NTV inventory accountability, \nand compliance with federal fleet management and safety \nrequirements.  DC I&L (LF) manages PMC funds for NTV acquisitions \nacross the Marine Corps enterprise.  \n4.B. Commanders, including installation or activity commanders, \ncommanding officers, inspector-instructors, or district directors, \nare responsible for all NTV assets assigned to support their command\nrequirements.\n4.B.1. The Commander will assign a single fleet manager for the \nmanagement, operation, and maintenance of NTVs under their command, \nwhether a regional command, an installation, or geographically \nseparated USMC activity. \n4.B.2. If a possible ADA violation is identified with the \nprocurement of an NTV, the Commander will follow the ADA violation\nprocess detailed in reference (b) Chapter 3.\n4.B.2.a. The Commander, within two weeks of discovery of a \npossible ADA violation, will initiate an initial review and prepare \nan initial report to be submitted through the appropriate command \nfinancial management channels.\n4.B.2.b. The respective Financial Management Office at HQMC will \nevaluate the suspected violation report and decide the appropriate \naction to take, per reference (b) Chapter 3.\n4.C. The assigned installation/activity fleet manager is the primary\npoint of contact authorized to request the acquisition, assignment, \ntransfer, and disposal of NTVs for the installation or activity.  \nFleet managers must submit validated/corrected Authorized Allowance \nLists (AALs) and inventory reports as required or requested to \nDC I&L (LF).\n5.  Funding.\n5.A. Centralized Procurement.  Considering the NTV program is a \ncentrally managed program, centralized procurement is the primary \nmethod in which DC I&L (LF) acquires all Marine Corps NTVs.  Fleet \nManagers will provide equipment specifications to DC I&L (LF) in \nstandardized format and characteristics, where possible, to achieve \nstandardization and efficiency throughout the fleet.\n5.A.1. Basic distinction between Expense costs, Investment costs, \nand Centrally Managed Program funding (i.e. PMC) is explained in \nreference (a), paragraph 2.1.\n5.A.1.a. As previously mentioned, the Marine Corps\u2019 NTV Program is a\ncentrally managed program which is managed by DC I&L(LF), whom has \nthe responsibility to purchase of NTV\u2019s without regard to the \npurchase value or being an expense or investment.\n5.A.1.b. It is understood that Commanders have some discretion with \nusing local Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding for expense \npurchases, up to the investment purchase threshold (i.e. $250,000), \nto operate and maintain their organization.  However, that local \npurchase discretion is not applicable to the Marine Corps NTV \nProgram.\n5.B. Local Procurement.  Only DC I&L (LF) may authorize local \nprocurement, with appropriated funds, of NTVs that are not \nautomotive vehicles, such as trailers, MHE, and engineering \nequipment, if there is a benefit in doing so for the Marine Corps.\n5.B.1. Commanders shall ensure that all requests for local \nprocurement of NTVs is coordinated with the fleet manager and \nforwarded to DC I&L (LF) for approval prior to taking any \ncontracting or procurement actions. When authorized, DC I&L (LF) \nwill allocate PMC funds for that approved procurement.\n5.B.2. Only PMC funds authorized by DC I&L (LF) shall be used for \nprocurement of NTVs, including local purchases. Fleet managers shall \nensure that PMC funds are awarded within the time designated by \nDC I&L (LF).\n5.B.3. Fleet managers shall track and monitor the local procurement \nprocess and provide DC I&L (LF) a status of procurement action 30 \ndays prior to expiration of funds.\n5.C. Authorized Allowance List (AAL). The total number of NTVs, \nwhich includes government owned and leased vehicles, in use at any \ncommand may not exceed the command\u2019s AAL without authorization from \nDC I&L (LF).\n5.D. Only centrally managed PMC funding shall be used to procure \nNTVs, and unauthorized local procurement of NTVs with other than PMC\nfunds is an ADA violation per references (a), (b), (d), and (e).  \nDC I&L (LF) will not issue United States Marine Corps (USMC) NTV \nregistration numbers or license plates for improperly purchased \nNTVs, unless the ADA violation is resolved or cured, and two \nconditions have been met:  (1) appropriate controls have been \nimplemented to ensure that unauthorized procurements will not \nreoccur, and (2) MCICOM (Financial Management and Comptroller) has\n concurred with any proposed funding corrections after reviewing \nthe appropriate reports and supporting documentation for an ADA \ninvestigation. NTVs added to the fleet as a result of an ADA \nviolation being resolved or cured may be transferred to meet a \ngreater need at another Marine Corps installation/activity.  \n5.E.  Upon discovery of a potential ADA violation, the initial \nfindings validated by an internal review, an in-depth and structured\ninvestigation is required per reference (b), Chapter 3.  If the \nconclusion of an official ADA violation investigation finds that a \nviolation occurred, the report of investigation, which includes the \nname(s) of the responsible individuals, will be submitted to the \nPresident through the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States.  \nWithin the Department of Defense, any report that concludes an ADA\nviolation occurred must identify one or more responsible officials.\n5.F.  Non-Appropriated fund (NAF) procurement of vehicles must be \napproved by the head of the Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality \n(NAFI) and comply with reference (g), in addition to all size, \nefficiency, and alternative fuel requirements from applicable NTV \npolicies and federal fleet management regulations.\n6.  For advice on the proper use of funds and the NTV acquisition \nprocess, contact your local Fleet Manager (MCINCR, MCIEAST, MCIWEST,\nor MCIPAC).\n7.  This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force. \n8.  RELEASE AUTHORIZED BY MAJGEN J.G. WOODWORTH, ASSISTANT DEPUTY\nCOMMANDANT, INSTALLATIONS AND LOGISTICS (FACILITIES).//"

Benson/CIV/PPO POF/Dep Branch Head/TEL: 703-692-4303/ \nemail: eugene.a.benson@usmc.mil   \nGENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  The Commandant of the Marine Corps directs \nthe following policy for Marines and Sailors assigned to USMC \nand joint commands, on the wear and purchase of body armor and \nPPE. This MARADMIN supersedes references (a, b, c, d, and e). \nPPE refers to Marine Corps approved body armor, helmets, \ngoggles, gloves, clothing, and other gear designed to protect \nthe wearer\u2019s body from battlefield injuries. The equipment and \ntraining information for service-approved PPE systems can be \nfound at https:(slash)(slash)app.mcboss.usmc.mil searching via \nprogram office: PMM-154.3 and via \nMarine Net course # mcsppe0306 -  Proper use of Personal \nProtective Equipment  \n2.  Individual Marines/Sailors may not use commercial PPE in \nlieu of government tested, approved, and issued PPE as outlined \nin the product information sheets referenced in paragraph 1.  \nCommanders are not authorized to utilize unit funds to purchase \ncommercial PPE items that have not been approved for use by \nMarine Corps Systems Command.\n3.  Ballistic spectacles and goggles authorized for use are \nlisted on the authorized protective eyewear list (APEL) and are \ncompatible with the universal prescription lens carrier.  While \nthe Marine Corps will continue to issue a single spectacle and \na single goggle, units may purchase other authorized ballistic \neyewear on the APEL through the defense logistics agency or the \npost-exchange. The latest APEL can be found at: \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.peosoldier.army.mil/equipment/\napproved-eyewear-qpl/\n4.  All forms of hearing protection devices are considered PPE, \nand the Marine Corps issues Hearing Enhancement Devices (HED) \n(TAMCN C01142F) and High Noise Hearing Enhancement Devices \n(HN-HED) (TAMCN C00142F). Commanders must ensure Marines comply \nwith ref (f) or ref (g) for helmet configuration and ref (h) \nguidelines to select appropriate hearing protection devices. \nHEDS shall be evaluated at least twice per year for appropriate \nuse and to replace any worn/deteriorated seals per ref (h).  \nCommanders will consult navy medicine occupational audiologists \nor industrial hygienists to determine from sound pressure \nmeasurements appropriate hearing protective devices for their \noperational needs, ensuring Marines have the correct single or \ndual hearing protection when necessary.  Per ref (h), the \nsafety objective is to protect Marines\u2019 exposure to any \nsteady-state noise having an 8-hour time-weighted average noise \nlevel greater than or equal to 85 decibels: or a single \nexposure to impulse and/or impact noise of 140 decibels peak \nor greater, regardless of duration.   \n5.  Marine Corps Body Armor Protection Levels (APLS).\n5.a.  A service-level policy defining specific armor protection \nlevels has been established with the intent of standardizing \nAPLS, enabling commanders to tailor armor protection based on \ntheir estimate of the situation or based on guidance from \nservice/joint/theater combatant commanders.  Higher APLS \nprovide increased ballistic protection through the addition of \nmodular armor components, increasing the areas of coverage \nand/or ballistic protection. Higher APLS correspond to greater \nweight, increased thermal loading, and reduced mobility, thus \ndegrading individual and unit performance over extended periods \nof time.\n5.b.  The following APLS are established and apply to all \nMarine Corps-issued armor systems. Read in two columns: \nAPL             Description \nLevel 0         No body armor worn \nLevel 1         Marine Corps-issued plate carrier with soft \n                armor only (defeats handgun and fragmentation \n                threats) \nLevel 2         Marine Corps-issued plate carrier with soft \n                armor, and front and back hard armor plates \n                (defeats rifle and fragmentation threats) \nLevel 3         Marine Corps-issued plate carrier with soft \n                armor, front and back hard armor plates, \n                and side hard armor plates (defeats rifle \n                and fragmentation threats). \nRemoval of the soft armor from the plate carrier compromises \nthe ballistic protection of the issued armor systems.  Soft \narmor must be worn in conjunction with ballistic plates in the \nissued plate carrier \u2013 failure to do so may result in severe \nbodily injury or death.  There are currently two variants of \nballistic plates fielded to the Fleet Marine Force: the \nEnhanced Small Arms Plate Insert (ESAPI) (TAMCN C30202E) and \nthe Lightweight Plate (LWP) (TAMCN C01342F). Commanders may \nchoose to utilize either variant based on the threat.\n5.c.  The Marine Corps-issued helmets authorized for operations \ninclude the Enhanced Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmet (ECVCH) \n(TAMCN C49942F), Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) (TAMCN C01202E), \nHigh Cut Enhanced Combat Helmet (HC ECH) (TAMCN C02222F), and \nthe Integrated Helmet System (IHS) (TAMCN C02222F) which were \ndesigned to provide both ballistic and blunt impact protection \nacross the full spectrum of operational environments. The \nhelmets consist of a shell, a suspension system (pads), a \nretention system (chinstrap), and include other accessories \nsuch as a night vision device mounting bracket and rail systems.  \nThe ballistic protection of these systems is provided by the \nconstruction and materials of the shell. The blunt impact \nprotection is provided by the construction, materials, and \nconfiguration of the suspension system. The suspension system \nmust have pads in an approved configuration. In accordance with \nref (f) or ref (g) the issued suspension system cannot be \nreplaced with commercial pads.  The screws in the helmet \nsupport the ballistic integrity and shall not be replaced with \ncommercial screws. Unit leaders will ensure initial training is \nconducted for Marines upon issue of the helmet. Commanders \nshall ensure approved helmets are worn in an approved \nconfiguration.\n5.d. Diving life preserver and buoyancy compensator listed in \nthe authorized for navy use (ANU) are not authorized for \nballistic protection until the configuration has been certified \nand approved by Marine Corps Systems Command. Commanders \ninterested in requesting diving life preserver and buoyancy \ncompensator for certification must follow the universal needs \nprocess.  Information can be found at: https:(slash)(slash)\nwww.cdi.marines.mil/units/cdd/universal-needs-process/\n5.e. Protective attachments may be worn with \nMarine Corps-issued body armor. It is impractical to establish \nAPLS that incorporate every possible configuration in which \nthese attachments may be worn. Commanders will designate the \nwear of Marine Corps approved helmets; ballistic eyewear; and \ngroin, neck, and throat protection as required by their units' \nmission, the threat, and local environmental considerations.\n5.f. The lightweight helmet (TAMCN C32152E) and the small arms \nprotective body armor (stocklist-3 item of TAMCN C35012E) are \nonly authorized for use by training command.\n5.g. Ballistic protection vendor samples are not authorized for \nuse without Marine Corps Systems Command oversight and approved \nsafety releases for limited user evaluations.\n6. Authority\n6.a.  Operating force commanders at the Lieutenant Colonel (O-5) \nlevel or higher are authorized to determine the required level \nof PPE (or APL when established) for wear by assigned personnel \nwithin the Marine Corps Systems Command approved systems.  This \ndetermination will be made based on mission \n(including during training), unit type, threat, and \nenvironmental factors.\n6.b.  Combatant, Joint Task Force (JTF), and service component \ncommanders retain the authority to prescribe the level of \nprotection worn by all assigned personnel.  In cases where \ncombatant, JTF, and/ or service component commanders have \nestablished a required level of PPE that is more restrictive \nthan that set by Marine Unit Commanders, Marines will adhere to \nthe highest level.  In cases where the APL is not designated, \nthe Marine Corps service policy places the authority to \ndesignate the APL on commanders, Lieutenant Colonel (O-5) \nand higher.\n6.c.  Based on their unique mission requirements, \nMarine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) personnel may, within \npublished MARSOC policies and subject to their commanders' \napproval, wear special operations command-approved special \npurpose body armor.\n6.d.  Installation commanders are authorized to use government \nfunds to purchase commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) body armor \nand PPE only for use by Military Police performing law \nenforcement duties aboard Marine Corps installations. COTS body \narmor must, at a minimum, meet National Institute of Justice \n(NIJ)-certified level RF2 as listed on the NIJ website. \nHttps:(slash)(slash)www.nij.gov/topics/technology/body-armor/\npages/compliant-ballistic-armor.aspx.  COTS body armor \npurchased for installation law enforcement duty will not be \nworn by Marines as a substitute for Marine Corps approved \nbody armor and PPE in a combat zone or theater of operation.\n7.  Marine Corps organizations that do not receive class II \nPPE materiel support from the Logistics Command should direct \nall materiel requirements to DC, IL, IP.\n8.  Release authorized by MajGen J. L. Morris, Assistant Deputy \nCommandant for Plans, Policies, and Operations.//"

Purpose.  To announce the creation of the\nMarine Corps Attack Drone Competition Program.\n2.  Background.  On 3 January 2025, the MCADT was established as\ndescribed in reference (a) as a means of enabling the Service\u2019s\nresponse to the rapid proliferation of armed first-person view\n(FPV) drone technology and tactics. CG TRNGCMD, as the Designated\nApproval Authority (DAA), has designated CO WTBn-Quantico as the \nAircraft Reporting Custodian (ARC) to conduct all activities \nrequired to support MCADT operations in accordance with references\n(b) and (d). The MCADT will participate in the first US Military\nDrone Crucible Championship hosted by the United States National\nDrone Association (USNDA) from 30 June 2025 to 3 July 2025 in \nFlorida, where the Marines will battle against other US military\nunits. The Drone Crucible Championship will consist of tactical\ninserts and mission parameters designed to utilize the\n\u201chunter-killer method\u201d of employing both sUAS and FPVs. After the\nJuly competition, the MCADT will share lessons learned to inform\niterative updates to Service-level requirements to enable rapid\nfielding of the most lethal capabilities to Marines across the\nFleet Marine Force (FMF). Simultaneously, the MCADT will finalize\nplans to provide intermediate and advanced armed FPV drone skills to\nthe FMF and Total Force via the Competition-in-Arms Program (CIAP),\nsimilar to what the Marine Corps Shooting Team has done annually for\nmany decades. Executing drone competitions in conjunction with the\nCIAP provides an opportunity to refine and constantly improve these\nnew precision weapons skills to help make Marines across the FMF\nmore lethal on the battlefield. More details will be included with\nthe release of the FY26 CIAP MARADMIN to include specific\ncompetition dates and locations.\n3.  Mission.  Through aggressive training and experimentation and\nby representing the Marine Corps in inter-service, national, and\ninternational competitions, the MCADT will rapidly accelerate armed\nFPV drone lessons learned from modern combat to increase our Corps\u2019\nwarfighting advantage. The MCADT will provide regular input to\nService-level requirements and deliver intermediate and advanced\narmed FPV drone skills to the Total Force via the CIAP to increase\nindividual and unit lethality.\n4.  MCADT Events\n4.a.  The MCADT will host regional competition events in FY26 in\nconjunction with the Marine Corps Shooting Team and the CIAP. These\nevents will provide the opportunity to share lessons learned in\narmed FPV tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) to FMF units to\nmaximize lethality and capabilities with these new systems. These\nevents will also provide training and administrative support to\nunits who are in the process of establishing FPV drone programs \nin their respective commands. Additionally, these events will serve\nas opportunities to recruit the best FPV operators to the MCADT to\ncontinue to represent the Marine Corps at future events and directly\ninfluence the Marine Corps\u2019 procurement and employment of armed\ndrones.\n4.b.  The MCADT will host a final championship and selection event\nat MCB Quantico in April 2026 in conjunction with the Marine Corps\nChampionships marksmanship event. This selection competition is the\nvenue for the MCADT to select the most highly qualified FPV drone\nand sUAS operators from across the Marine Corps to augment the\nMCADT during interservice and national competitions. Marines\nselected to augment the MCADT should expect to receive \nWTBn-Quantico-funded TAD orders.\n5.  Tasks\n5.a.  Regional hosting units\n5.a.1.  Serve as the lead planners for assigned match locations. \nCoordinate with local commands and the MCADT to ensure maximum\nparticipation.

Purpose.  To announce the creation of the\nMarine Corps Attack Drone Team (MCADT).\n2.  Situation.  On 3 January 2025, the Commanding Generals of\nTraining Command (TRNGCMD) and the Marine Corps Warfighting\nLaboratory (MCWL) established the MCADT to address the rapid\nproliferation of armed First Person View (FPV) drone technology and\ntactics, which have been proven in conflicts worldwide, particularly\nin Eastern Europe. These developments are transforming warfare with\nunprecedented lethality and hit ratios. As the Designated Approval\nAuthority (DAA), CG TRNGCMD has designated the Commanding Officer\n(CO) of Weapons Training Battalion-Quantico (WTBn-Quantico) as the\nAircraft Reporting Custodian (ARC) to oversee all MCADT-related\nactivities in accordance with references (b) and (d). The MCADT\u2019s\nplacement at WTBn-Quantico leverages 124 years of precision \nweapons expertise from the Marine Corps Shooting Team and the WTBn\n-Quantico Precision Weapons Section (PWS). The MCADT will focus on\nidentifying and disseminating lessons learned to inform updates to\nService-level requirements, training, and doctrine, enabling rapid\ndeployment of armed FPV drone capabilities across the FMF.\nAdditionally, the MCADT will deliver intermediate and advanced armed\nFPV drone training to the FMF and Total Force through the\nCompetition-in-Arms Program (CIAP), following reference (b).\n3.  Mission.  Through aggressive training and experimentation and by\nrepresenting the Marine Corps in inter-service, national, and\ninternational competitions, the MCADT will rapidly accelerate armed\nFPV drone lessons learned from modern combat to increase our Corps\u2019\nwarfighting advantage. The MCADT will provide regular input to \nService-level requirements and deliver intermediate and advanced\narmed FPV drone skills to the Total Force via the CIAP to\nincrease individual and unit lethality.\n4.  Execution\n4.a.  Commander\u2019s Intent\n4.a.1.  Purpose.  To increase our Corps\u2019 lethality through the\nuse of armed FPV drones.\n4.a.2.  Method.  The MCADT will refine armed FPV drone tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTP) through continuous training,\nexperimentation, and competition, driving service requirements and\nenhancing battlefield capabilities for Marines. The MCADT will \nregularly share lessons learned with HQMC and the Total Force, \nintegrating new Marines to expand expertise across the Service.\n4.a.3.  Endstate.  The MCADT captures the most innovative armed\nFPV drone technological solutions, TTPs from across the joint force,\nallies and partners, and industry; disseminates those insights and\nlessons learned across the Total Force; and informs Marine Corps\nrequirements, investment priorities and acquisition decisions to\nmaximize our Marines\u2019 lethality and warfighting advantage.\n4.b. Concept of Operations.  The MCADT is a collaborative effort\nbetween Training Command/WTBn-Quantico and MCWL, supported by the\nFMF and joint force. Initially task-organized within existing \nFY25 resources, it will be assessed for potential transition to\npermanent structure. The MCADT develops and sustains armed FPV drone\nexpertise through top-tier inter-service, international, and\ncivilian competitions, including Marine Corps annual marksmanship\nevents starting in FY26.\n4.c.  Tasks\n4.c.1.  CG TRNGCMD\n4.c.1.a.  Serve as the MCADT DAA.\n4.c.1.b.  Identify and allocate, as able, the resources\n(e.g., staffing, equipment, and facilities) required to sustain\niterative improvement to program of record (POR) and non-POR drone\nsystems and inform Service capabilities, requirements, acquisition,\ntraining, and doctrine.\n4.c.1.c.  Support the MCADT competition to accelerate attack drone\ncapability development.\n4.c.1.d.

Support MCADT experimentation and iterative\nimprovement of POR and non-POR drone systems to inform Service\nrequirements, acquisition, training, and doctrine.\n4.d.  Coordinating Instructions. The DAA and ARC will comply with\nrequirements as set forth in reference (c).\n4.d.2.  The MCADT will receive advice and assistance from the\nTECOM G-6 to ensure necessary coordination with FMF and local\ninstallation frequency managers is completed in time to support\nthe incorporation of drone competitions in the FY26 CIAP.\n4.d.3.  Director, Range and Training Programs Division (RTPD) will\ncoordinate with MCICOM to establish service-level conditions for\nattack drone operations and training, including competitions\nand simulations that enable realistic FMF training.\n5.  Administration and Logistics\n5.a.  The MCADT is authorized to utilize POR systems, non-POR\nsystems from the Blue List, and any National Defense Authorization\nAct (NDAA) approved systems or parts for competition and\nexperimentation if approved in accordance with reference\n(d) or other applicable policy.\n5.b.  Per reference (d), utilization of the Intelligent Robotics\nand Autonomous Systems (IRAS) SharePoint at https:(slash)(slash)\nusmc.sharepoint-mil.us/sites/DCCDI/SitePages/DistroD/Intelligent\n-Robotics-and-Autonomous-Systems.aspx will assist in the process\nfor purchase of Blue UAS in the Blue UAS Handbook.\n6.

Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (g), if the\nrespective commanding officer determines that an officer is not\nmentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for\npromotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the\nphysical examination requirement for reserve officers per section\n10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the\nofficer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the\nappointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the\nnotice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers\nmust also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the\nappointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps\nTotal Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of\nadministrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain\nguidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.\n3.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this\npromotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or\npotentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)\nremoved the names of those officers with records identified during\nthe adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially\nadverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN.  Those\nofficers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC\n(JPL).\n4.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary\nretirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to\nacceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion\ncarries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with\naugmentation into the regular component.\n5.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve\nofficer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have\naccepted such promotion on the effective date contained in\nparagraph 2 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in\nthe grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion, an officer is\nrequired to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPB-10)\nexpressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion\nand directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher\ngrade.  Any statement or action by the officer which signals their\nacceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline.\n6.  For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-9705 or\nDSN 278-9705.  Email inquiries may be submitted via the Officer\nPromotions homepage at www.Marines.mil.  Email address is\nofficerpromotions@usmc.mil.\n7.  Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower\nManagement Division.//"

Marines who require additional \nmedical documents will be contacted by the MCRC POC.  Each additional \nsubmission of medical information forwarded by the Marine will \nrestart the 30-day process for medical determinations at BUMED and \nNAMI.  Commands and Marines are not authorized to contact or forward \nany medical documents directly to BUMED or MCRC Medical Reviewers.  \nAll updated documentation must be forwarded to the MCRC POC for \ntracking purposes.  Deferred Marines will be scheduled by MCRC POC to \nan OCC once a medical determination has been made by either BUMED or \nNAMI.  Marines who sustain an injury prior to reporting to OCS must \nimmediately contact the MCRC POC and provide supporting medical \ndocuments to include light duty chit.  Supporting documentation must \nprovide the nature of the injury and the expected begin and return to \nfull duty date.  Questions pertaining to additional medical documents \nrequested by BUMED or NAMI should be directed to the MCRC medical \nreviewers at (703) 784-9426 or email donald.irwin@marines.usmc.mil or \nsarah.delapena@marines.usmc.mil.  Questions pertaining to status of \nBUMED or NAMI medical determinations must be directed to MCRC POC.  \n10.  Pre-OCS information.  OCS class dates are tentative and subject \nto change.  Every effort will be made to schedule Marines to the \nfirst available OCS class immediately following a selection board \nhowever this is not guaranteed.  MCRC will determine which OCC a \nMarine will be scheduled to attend once medically qualified and \nutilizing allocations and the accession needs of the Marine Corps.  \nMarines nor Commands should be checking MCTIMS for OCS attendance.  \nOfficial notification will be sent via email notification by MCRC POC \napproximately 45-60 days prior to shipping.  Refer to reference (f) \nfor OCC report and graduation dates.  Marines who were not initially \nscheduled may be contacted by the MCRC POC up to two weeks prior to \nan OCC class and be afforded the opportunity to attend if extra \nallocations are made available.  This MARADMIN modifies reference (a) \nCommander's Intent, pertaining to OCS opportunities.  Marines who do \nnot attend the first two assigned OCC classes after selection will \nautomatically be disenrolled from the program.  \n     a.  Marines are directed to use references (g), (h) and the OCS \nwebsite listed in paragraph 5a, for specific requirements prior to \narriving to OCS.  Marines notified of OCC attendance will be provided \nan updated reference (g) and other OCS pertinent information once \navailable.  Scheduled Marines' MHS GENESIS profiles must be complete \nno later than 30 days prior to report date.  Refer to reference (g) \nfor required items.   \n     b.  Refer to references (f) for 2026 OCC class dates.  Once \nnotified of scheduled OCC by MCRC, Marines are directed to submit \npre-ship checklist in reference (g). Officers in Charge and Marines \nare responsible to ensure all information on the pre-ship checklist \nis filled out, and it is signed and dated.  Commands will ensure all \nMarines are within Marine Corps standards and have a first class or \nhigher PFT prior to issuing Defense Travel System orders or shipping \nto OCS.  \n     c.  A first class PFT is required for shipping to OCS.   \nPre-ship PFTs must be taken no earlier than 60 days and no later than \n30 days of scheduled OCC report date when possible. Ensure \ninformation is annotated in the PFT portion of the checklist.  Refer \nto reference (h) for OCS PFT guidance.  Commands must ensure Marines' \nPFT information meets the requirements of reference (h), prior to \nsubmission of the checklist.  Marines who do not meet the above \nrequirements are not eligible to report to the scheduled OCC, and this \nwill count as one attempt.  If this is the second attempt to attend \nOCS, the Marine will be disenrolled from their respective programs.  \n     d.  All \"yes\" answers to questions under the Candidate Section \non the checklist that have not been previously disclosed or waived by \nMCRC prior to selection must include the signed applicable forms and \nsigned detailed handwritten statements explaining events, to include \nsupporting documents per reference (d).\n11.  Funding.  MECEP and ECP Marines, notified of attendance to an \nOCC by MCRC POC, will be provided a funding letter along with \nadditional guidance.  Scheduled Marines must forward the funding \nletter to their parent commands for issuance of Temporary Additional \nDuty orders to attend OCS.  Questions concerning funding should be \ndirected to the email located in the funding letter or the Marine's \nDTS administrators, not MCRC.

Upon approval of orders by Training and Education Command \n(TECOM), scheduled Marines are required to provide to the MCRC POC no \nfewer than five business days prior to the report date one of the \nfollowing:\n          (1) Marines on non-local funded travel (over 50 miles) must \nprovide a copy of approved DTS or DD Form 1610 orders with the TECOM \nline of accounting in accounting classification, or;\n          (2) Marines on local non-funded travel (50 miles or less) \nmust provide command endorsed orders.\n     c. All information identified in above sub-paragraphs a and b \nmust be received by MCRC POC within established deadlines established \nvia email notification prior to reporting to OCS.  Failure to provide \nthe above information once notified can result in removal from the \nscheduled OCS class and possible disenrollment from respective \nprograms.\n12.  Additional information.\n     a.  Marines are considered officer candidates while attending \nOCS, and are entitled to pay and allowances commensurate with the \nenlisted grade shown on the original orders to OCS, but not less than \nthat prescribed for a sergeant.  Upon completion of training at OCS, \nthe original pay and allowances for corporals and below will be \nrestored.\n     b.  Officer candidates who are dropped from or otherwise do not \nsuccessfully graduate OCS will return to their parent commands or \ndirected duty stations.  All drops are conditionally retained in \ntheir respective programs unless it is the second unsuccessful \nattempt, drop on request, or the Marine is not recommended to return \nto OCS.  MCRC POC will provide official notification of retained \nMarines with next course of action upon receipt of official drop \npackage from OCS.  Do not contact MCRC until after receipt of \nofficial correspondence.  If dropped due to medical, contact your \nPCM to be evaluated for the medical drop reason provided to you by \nOCS and begin documenting the medical process.  Official \ncorrespondence will provide guidance that is required for \nresubmission to MCRC to forward to BUMED or to be rescheduled for an \nOCC.  A complete physical is not required.  Only medical \ndocumentation pertaining to the injury or medical condition, from \nonset to full duty, need to be provided.\n     c.  Prior service candidates who are disenrolled by the \nCommanding Officer (CO), OCS for unsatisfactory conduct or because of \na Drop on Own Request will receive a \u201cnot observed\u201d adverse report in \naccordance with Marine Corps Order 1610.7F Chapter 5, paragraph 3. d. \n(6), \u201cComments pertaining to the Marine Reported On (MRO)\u2019s drop \nfrom, or failure at, a school because of the MRO\u2019s unwillingness to \ntry, cavalier attitude, or unprofessional conduct or ability to meet \nrequired standards are adverse\u201d.  The CO, OCS, is authorized to \neffect involuntary disenrollment for cause during any phase of the \ntraining.  The CO, OCS, can recommend an OCS class outside the \nauthorized 10-week class for E-O applicants who are dropped from OCS \nhowever, CG MCRC, is the final adjudicating official.\n13.  Post OCS graduation.  \n     a.  After graduation from OCS, Marines will report back to their \nparent commands or directed duty stations.  All claims for travel \nreimbursements must be completed within five business days upon \nreturn to parent commands or directed duty stations.  ECPs, RECPs, \nand MCP-Rs will receive their orders for TBS prior to departing OCS \nto execute from their parent commands or directed duty stations and \nare directed to submit a TBS checklist with final OCS PFT and all \nsignatures to MCRC POC or representative prior to OCS graduation.  \n     b.  Upon verification of graduation from OCS, and receipt of a \nNROTC or affiliated school acceptance letter with NROTC Unit \nacceptance letter annotating a semester or quarter start and no later \nthan date, as outlined in reference (d), the MCRC POC will request \nManpower Enlisted Assignments (MMEA) issue Permanent Change of \nStation (PCS) or Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) orders for \nMECEPs.  MECEPs who submit the two letters close to the end of the \nfiscal year, in the event of a government shutdown, during MCRC board \nseason, or incorrect status codes may experience a delay in orders \ndue to priority workload, funding restrictions or code corrections.  \n     c.  Due to student seat availability at the NROTC Units, MECEP \nMarines must apply to three separate NROTC or affiliated schools. If \nthe unit has availability, the Marine can apply to the \ncollege/university.  NROTC and affiliated schools can be found at \nwww.netc.navy.mil scroll down then select NROTC Schools.  \n     d.  Upon submission of both letters, MECEP Marines will receive \nPCS or PCA orders to the NROTC or affiliated school as directed.   \nOrders cannot be issued by MMEA if both acceptance letters are not \nreceived by MCRC or there are fewer than 90 days until the NROTC \nunit\u2019s no later than date for PCS orders.  As many universities have \nmoved away from hard copy acceptance letters, the official acceptance \nemail from a school official will suffice. Ensure the acceptance \nletters from both the NROTC unit and the school contain the same \nauthorized semester start time frame.  Formal requests to attend the \nNROTC or affiliated school outside of directed semester starts per \nreference (d) are not authorized except for PCA moves or extenuating \nmedical circumstances.  Supporting medical documentation must be \nsubmitted for review and approval by MCRC.\n     e.  MECEPs are not authorized to initiate any PCS or PCA moves \nprior to being issued orders.  \n     f.  MECEPs refer to references (a) and (i) for obligated service \nand pertinent information and ensure the Special Officer Program \nRELM type is used.  Questions pertaining to re-enlistments/\nextensions per reference (i) should be directed to MMEA-1 at \n(703) 432-9019. Enlistment/Reenlistment must be approved prior to \nexecuting PCS/PCA orders.  MECEPs whose enlistment/reenlistments have \nnot been approved and have a limited timeline to execute orders (less \nthan 2 weeks to report date), please contact the MCRC POC for \nassistance.  \n     g.  MECEPs are directed to contact the Marine Officer Instructor \nor Assistant Marine Officer Instructor at their prospective NROTC or \naffiliated school for introductions and other pertinent information.      \n     h.  MECEPs are not authorized to attend any school not listed \nunder NROTC schools or that annotate Registered Nurse (RN) option \nonly or Navy option only on the above website.  \n     i.  MECEPs are not authorized to attend graduate schools until \nafter completion of TBS.   \n     j.  MECEPs are not authorized PCS moves from their original \nNROTC or affiliated school without prior approval from MCRC.  \n     k.  Failure to provide both the NROTC or affiliated school and \nNROTC Unit acceptance letters within one year of OCS graduation, will \nresult in disenrollment from the program.  \n     l.  MECEP Marines who successfully graduate OCS must provide the \ndocuments listed on the MECEP Inbound Checklist to their assigned \nNROTC or affiliated school upon reporting.  The MECEP Inbound \nChecklist can be found on the MCRC website listed in paragraph 5d \nunder General Forms.  \n     m.  MECEP Marines must maintain a first class PFT and CFT for \nthe entirety of their time in the program.\n14.  Post TBS information.  The Commandant's Education Board, which \nselects Marine Officers to attend graduate schools between the grades \nof first lieutenant and major, requires Marines to have qualifying \ncalculus and science classes for selection to certain Postgraduate \nSchool, Air Force Institute of Technology, and Defense Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency (DARPA) programs (e.g. Naval Fellowships).  \nFor this reason, MECEP students are highly encouraged to pursue \ndegrees within Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics \n(STEM) curriculums to qualify for these graduate education and \nfellowship opportunities.  Marines who pursue non-STEM degrees are \nlikewise encouraged to take calculus I and II and calculus-based \nscience classes to qualify for selection to these programs in the \nfuture.

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan recognized the\nimmeasurable contributions of military spouses by designating a day\nin their honor.  This recognition was more than a gesture, it was an\nacknowledgment of the vital role that spouses play in the readiness\nand success of our armed forces.  That truth remains just as\nrelevant today.  Through every challenge, military spouses continue\nto thrive in an ever changing, often unpredictable way of life,\noffering unwavering support to their loved ones and their\ncommunities.\n2.  The strength of the Marine Corps is rooted in the unwavering\nsupport of our spouses, who play a critical role in ensuring the\nreadiness and lethality of our Marines.

As our service has \nexperienced relatively low mishap numbers over the past few years, \nrecent trends indicate a culture of noncompliance among riders.  As \na service, we share accountability and cannot allow this trend to\ncontinue.  We must use every tool at our disposal to\nensure our Marine riders are identified, trained, and mentored.\n2.  Reference (a) outlines motorcycle safety requirements for both \nunit leaders and Marine riders.  All members shall familiarize \nthemselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  \n3.  The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Safety Division (CMC SD), is \nactively supporting unit leaders and individual Marines in \nestablishing effective unit motorcycle programs.  In collaboration \nwith Manpower and Reserve Affairs, CMC SD has organized and updated \na list of safety-related training and additional duty codes to \nstreamline the reporting process and ensure accurate recording and \nmanagement of completed safety training.  Reference (b) offers an \nupdated list of applicable codes, which should be utilized to update \nindividual training records within the Marine Corps Total Force \nSystem (MCTFS) and The Marine Corps Training Information Management \nSystem (MCTIMS).\n4.  Per reference (c), and no later than 30 May 2025, 05/06 \ncommanders are directed to conduct a comprehensive assessment of all \nMarines to better understand motorcycle ridership within the Marine \nCorps.  This includes identifying who rides motorcycles, determining \ncompleted or required training, and verifying the status of riders' \nlicenses/endorsements.  A tasker will be sent via ETMS2 for all \nunits to report unit's completion.\n5.  Commanders are to review, verify, and document each member's \nriding status and training records in MCTIMS/MCTFS using the updated \ncodes from reference (b).  The objective is to confirm the accuracy \nof both unit and individual training records.  Any identified \ndeficiencies such as missing training or licenses must be addressed \npromptly.\n6.  All Marines who ride motorcycles, regardless of their intention \nto ride on base, are required to report their riding activity, \ncompleted training, and license/endorsement status.  Failure to \nreport this information is subject to punishment under the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ).  Commanding officers and officers \nin charge are responsible for ensuring accountability and taking \nappropriate action against members who fail to report their riding \nstatus.\n7.  We are committed to enhancing our capacity to prevent avoidable \nlosses among Marine riders. Your leadership in training, education, \nand mentorship remains crucial in safeguarding our Marines.\n8.  Semper Fidelis, Paul J. Rock, Jr., Lieutenant General, U.S. Marine \nCorps, Director the Marine Corps Staff.//"

Per REF A-M, the following guidance\nupdates Service policy and procedures to support the continued \nplanning, execution, and sustainment of the Marine Corps Training\nMission \u2013 United Arab Emirates (MCTM-UAE) and associated Foreign \nMilitary Sales (FMS) cases through 2029. This MARADMIN provides\nupdated Service-level guidance regarding personnel assignment \npolicy, pre-deployment training requirements for inbound \nMCTM-UAE Marines, and procedures for requesting support from the\nFleet Marine Force and supporting establishment for CONUS-based \ntraining and exercise events with the UAE Presidential Guard (PG).\nThis MARADMIN supersedes and cancels MARADMIN 123/17.\n2.  Background. \n2.A.  MCTM-UAE is a Title 22-authorized security assistance mission\nexecuted by the Marine Corps to train and advise the UAE PG. \nSince April 2011, this mission has consisted of two primary \ncomponents: Marine advisors assigned in-country with the PG \nHeadquarters and with brigade-level units; and annual CONUS\ndeployments for training (DFT) of PG units to train and exercise\nwith Marine units at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC),\nTwentynine Palms, CA; Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center\n(MCMWTC), Bridgeport, CA; Camp Pendleton (CPEN), CA; and \nCamp Lejeune, NC (CLNC). \n2.B.  IAW REF A, the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) has \nre-committed to both components of this mission through the end of\nFY29, but with new limits for MCTM-UAE structure and Service support\nof PG CONUS DFTs. The Marine Corps will continue to be financially \nreimbursed for personnel assigned to MCTM-UAE and for CONUS training\nactivities through the extension of related FMS cases with the \nUAE. 2.C.  Changes to the manpower structure and to the design of \nengagements reflect an understanding that the USMC-UAE PG \nrelationship has matured from small-unit tactical advisors to \nbrigade-level advisors focused on task organization, unit training \nmanagement, and facilitation of CONUS training events, exercises, \nand bilateral engagement. \n2.D.  Within the context of CMC planning guidance and USMC security\ncooperation strategy, the Marine Corps intends to transition its\npartnership with the UAE PG from FMS training to regular Title 10\nengagement. This transition includes the off-ramp of Permanent \nChange of Station Orders (PCSO)-assigned Marines to the MCTM-UAE\nprogram by the end of FY29. Marines assigned to MCTM-UAE FY25-29\nwill assist MARCENT planners in developing an off-ramp plan and\nsupport communication of the plan to USEMB Abu Dhabi and UAE \nleadership. \n3.  Policy.\n3.A.  Personnel Assignment.\n3.A.1.  MCTM-UAE will be staffed via PCSO until the end of FY29 to\nprovide flexibility in Marine assignments and to enhance \nrelationships and rapport with foreign military officials. \nThe preferred sourcing will be for two-year, accompanied orders.\nOne-year, unaccompanied orders will be considered on a case-by-case\nbasis.\n3.A.2.  PCSO require losing commands to take specific actions and \nprovide oversight on critical pre-PCS requirements necessary to\nprepare and train Marines before reporting to MCTM-UAE.\n3.A.3.  IAW REF I, MCTM-UAE Marines, and their families, \nif accompanied, must be medically qualified for world-wide \ndeployment, per standard DON medical screening processes, \nand subsequent in-country Department of State/U.S. Embassy\n(DOS/USEMB) medical authorities.\n3.A.4.  Upon receipt of PCSO, Marines will receive reporting \ninstructions from the MCTM-UAE Officer in Charge (OIC) detailing\nthe requirements for PCS and pre-PCS training.\n3.A.5.  In addition to traditional service component functions,\nthe Commander of Marine Forces Central Command (COMUSMARCENT) will \nexercise administrative control (ADCON) of MCTM-UAE Marines to \ninclude pay, entitlements, awards, and assisting with coordination\nof MCTM-UAE Marines\u2019 pre-PCS requirements.\n3.A.6.  IAW Title 22 authorities, MCTM-UAE personnel operate under\nchief of mission authority and are prohibited from participating\nin contingency, combat, or other operations with the UAE PG.\n3.B.  Pre-Deployment Training for Marines Assigned to MCTM-UAE.\n3.B.1.  The Pre-Deployment Training Program (PTP), conducted \nannually for inbound MCTM-UAE Marines, will consist of \nthree training packages:\n3.B.1.A.  IAW REF H, USMC-led foreign advisor training tailored\nto the MCTM-UAE Mission, such as the modified Marine Advisor \nCourse (MAC). \n3.B.1.B.  IAW REF I, Foreign Area Counter Threat (FACT)\ntraining through the DOS Foreign Service Institute.\n3.B.1.C.  IAW REF M, training, as required, on the duties\nrelating to the arrival and escort of foreign military personnel\non Marine Corps installations and the policies and procedures \ngoverning the disclosure of military information to representatives \nof foreign governments. Completion of the following training will \nbe at the direction of the MCTM-UAE OIC before or after arrival \nin UAE:  \n3.B.1.C.1  International Military Student Office Manager (IMSO).\nMCTM-UAE personnel may be called upon to act as IMSO for PG soldiers\nparticipating in USMC courses. The IMSO course is provided virtually\nby the Defense Security Cooperation University; contact the TECOM\nSecurity Assistance (SA) Branch to coordinate course entry. \n3.B.1.C.2  Contact Officer training. MCTM-UAE personnel will on \noccasion act as contact officers for visiting delegations of PG. \nContact officer training is always available on MARINENET \n(course number: FDO2CTOF01).\n3.B.1.C.3  Foreign Disclosure Officer training. MCTM-UAE personnel\nare required to be well-versed in the subject of Foreign Disclosure.\nThis is key to identifying and protecting information that is not\nreleasable to international partners. FDO course is in-person and\navailable at multiple USMC installations throughout the year. \nContact the PLU CENTCOM Desk Officer for list of available times \nand dates. \n3.B.2.  Personnel in receipt of PCSO to MCTM-UAE will execute FMS \ncase-funded Temporary Additional Duty (TAD) to identified locations\nfor training prior to detaching from the losing command.  \nMCTM-UAE OIC will provide coordination instructions to losing \ncommands.  \n3.B.3.  Temporary Duty Under Instruction (TEMINS) is not a viable\noption for PTP due to constraints of scheduling the required \ntraining and the requirements of the PCS cycle. \n3.B.4.  MARCENT will provide a line of accounting (LOA) for TAD \norders to support pre-PCS training.  Training and travel are \nFMS-case funded, via MARCENT disbursal and oversight. \n3.B.5.  Receipt of the 0571, Foreign Security Force (FSF) \nOperational Advisor Free Military Occupational Specialty (FMOS).\n3.B.5.A.  IAW REF H, Marines assigned to MCTM who complete the\nmodified MAC must complete a minimum of six (6) months as a PG\nadvisor prior to eligibility for the 0571 FMOS.\n3.B.5.B.  MCTM Marines who participate in other Services\u2019 or \ninteragency advisor training in lieu of the modified MAC must\nreceive a waiver from HQMC PP&O PLU prior to eligibility for the\n0571 FMOS.     \n3.B.5.C.  MCTM-UAE OIC is the approving authority for MCTM Marines\napplying for 0571 FMOS. MARCENT IPAC or the gaining IPAC of a Marine\ncompleting a MCTM tour may process the approved 0571 FMOS.  \n3.C.  UAE PG CONUS Training and Exercise Events.\n3.C.1.  Background.  The PG participates in CONUS-based training,\nexercises, and other bilateral engagement to build readiness, \nimprove interoperability with USMC units, and to develop \nexpeditionary competency. The Marine Corps supports these events\nbecause they align to USMC and CENTCOM security cooperation \nobjectives and foster positive relations with a strategic regional\npartner. Support from the Fleet Marine Force is essential to the \nsuccess of CONUS engagements with the UAE PG and to the resilience \nof the overall partnership.\n3.C.2.  IAW REF A, and in recognition of current fleet operational\ntempo, the CMC has approved a new limit of (4) PG CONUS DFTs per \nfiscal year FY25-29. Annual PG CONUS DFTs will be the following \ntypes unless otherwise requested and approved via formal message \ntraffic to DC PP&O: 1x DFT CPEN, 1x DFT CLNC, 1x integration in\nService Level Training Exercise (SLTE), 1x Mountain Warfare \nTraining Exercise (MTX).\n3.C.3.  In alignment with the maturing nature of the partnership,\nthe leaders of both forces desire a greater focus on regular \nbilateral exercises and interoperability engagement \n(Title 10 authority), while retaining the ability to conduct formal\ntraining (Title 22 authority). It is expected that the PG \ndetachments will execute both Title 10 activity and Title 22 \ntraining with Marine units during CONUS DFTs. This requires \ncareful planning and design of each DFT iteration to ensure \nappropriate identification of the authority to conduct an activity\nand to capture full reimbursement of USMC cost for the Title 22 \ntraining.  \n3.C.3.A.  MARCENT, ICW PP&O PLU, will assist MCTM-UAE in determining\nthe appropriate Title authority of a UAE PG \u2013 USMC activity where\nambiguity exists. MARCORSYCOM-International Programs (MCSC-IP) and \nTECOM SA Branch will determine if an activity can be reimbursed by\nthe FMS cases in REF B and C. \n3.C.3.A.1.  For unique training requirements that are requested by\nthe UAE PG and not covered under current case language, case \namendments may take 6 months or more to complete.\n3.C.3.B.  Formal Training under Title 22 authority. For CONUS DFT\nevents that include USMC curriculum-based instruction, or a program\nof instruction (POI) led exclusively by Marine instructors, the UAE \nPG soldiers receiving training will be considered International \nMilitary Students (IMS), and they must travel on Invitational Travel \nOrders (ITO). Formal training from the Marine Corps to the PG is \nfunded via the FMS case listed in REF B. Participation in a formal\ncourse at any Marine Corps unit or training institution, such \nas MCMWTC, or a driver course for tactical vehicles, \nfalls within this category.\n3.C.3.B.1.  Throughout the planning cycle of each DFT, MCTM-UAE \nshall notify TECOM SA Branch of any formal training planned for\nexecution during a PG CONUS DFT.  TECOM SA Branch requires no less\nthan 90 days prior to DFT execution to complete activity costing. \nUSMC units instructing UAE personnel shall provide a training POI \nand training costs to TECOM SA Branch. TECOM SA Branch will provide \nthe Activity Costing Worksheet (ACW) and assist unit in \ndetermination of cost.\n3.C.3.B.2.  Units and/or schools must have an IMSO designated when\nIMS on ITO are participating in a course. An IMSO is designated in \nwriting by the unit or schoolhouse commander after completion of \nonline training. MCTM-UAE will provide IMSOs for any unit or \nschoolhouse without a designated IMSO where PG students are \nparticipating in formal training.\n3.C.3.C.  Bilateral Training and Exercises under Title 10 \nauthorities. For CONUS engagements or exercises during which\nMarines and PG soldiers are training together, or PG are training\nunilaterally, PG soldiers will be considered foreign visitors and\nwill travel on an approved foreign visit request (FVR). For FY25-29,\nUnit Enhancement Training (UET) or participation as an exercise \nforce during an SLTE will fall within this category. Administrative\nand logistic support provided to the PG will be funded via the FMS \ncase identified in REF C.\n3.C.3.C.1.  Partner forces under an approved FVR must be managed by\na trained and designated Contact Officer \n(see section 3.B.6.B above). MCTM-UAE will work with FDOs, \nbase security, and host units to establish the escort plan for PG\non USMC installations. Base commanders shall provide appropriate \nguidance to MCTM contact officers.\n3.C.3.D.  When a CONUS PG event or exercise includes both formal\ntraining and bilateral exercise, the PG soldiers participating in \nthe formal training will be on ITOs for the duration of the event,\nall others will be accounted for on an approved FVR. \n3.C.3.E. IAW REF M, exercise design will dictate escort \nrequirements. MCTM-UAE and hosting units are responsible for \ndeveloping an appropriate escort plan per the requirements for \nITOs or FVRs. MCTM-UAE will ensure both types of escorts are planned\nfor CONUS PG events with formal training and bilateral, or \nunilateral, training.\n3.C.3.F.  Visa applications and process will be in accordance with\nthe separate requirements for FVR and ITO.\n3.C.4.  Force Sourcing for PG CONUS DFTs:\n3.C.4.A.  Annual Plan. NLT 30 Apr, MCTM-UAE shall publish Embassy \nmessage traffic to COMUSMARCENT articulating a consolidated \nfeasibility-of-support (FOS) request for PG COUNUS DFTs for the\nfollowing fiscal year. \n3.C.4.A.1.  MARCENT will review, validate, and forward the annual\nplan via NIPR   Automated Message Handling System (AMHS) to \nPP&O PLU. PP&O PLU will review, endorse, and forward the validated \nplan to prospective force providers, supporting organizations, and \nhost installations. PP&O POC(S) will ensure MCTM-UAE requirements\nare registered in the Force Management Tool (FMT).\n3.C.4.A.2.  PP&O PLU recommends informal coordination throughout\nthe planning cycle between MCTM-UAE, stakeholder organizations, and\nthe intended, or likely, force providers for each event in the \nannual plan.  \n3.C.4.B.  Force sourcing and response to Annual Plan: \n3.C.4.B.1.  PP&O PLU requests official AMHS response to the PG \nCONUS DFT annual plan from MARFOR force providers and supporting\nestablishment (TECOM, MCICOM) NLT 31 July. Force providers shall\nrespond in the FMT concurrent to and aligned with AMHS response to\nPP&O PLU. \n3.C.4.B.2.  Force Sync Conferences (FSC) are the primary forum for\nadjudicating sourcing solutions to PG CONUS DFT requirements. \nMCTM-UAE, will send a representative to FSC, as necessary, to brief\nrequested support and, ICW MARCENT representatives, advocate with \nMARFORPAC/I MEF, MARFORCOM/II MEF, MARFORRES, and MARSOC for \nsourcing solutions to PG CONUS DFTs.\n3.C.4.B.2.A. PG CONUS DFTs will be included as sourcing requirements\nin the Marine Corps Bulletin (MCBUL) 3120.    \n3.C.4.B.3.  Supporting unit requirements: A MARFOR/MEF commitment to\nsupport one of the (4) annual PG CONUS DFTs is an agreement to \nprovide both of the following supporting units or unit detachments:  \n3.C.4.B.3.A.  Partnering Unit.  A cohesive, combat arms unit that\nconducts bilateral tactical training with the PG unit. The training\nor exercise objectives will vary by event and PG unit. \n3.C.4.B.3.B.  Exercise Implementation Unit (hosting unit).  A unit\nor task-organized detachment, separate from the partner unit, that\nprovides administrative and logistical hosting support to satisfy \nUSMC installation requirements and all safety regulations and \npolicies. General responsibilities include escort duties, \ncoordinating ammunition support, coordinating target support,\ntactical vehicle provisioning and maintenance, line of accounting\nsupport, medical support, and range safety structure personnel. \n3.C.4.B.3.B.1.  The Exercise Implementation Unit or adjacent unit\nshall assist MCTM-UAE with range and training area reservations in \nthe Range Facility Management Support System or other required \nmethod.\n3.C.4.B.3.B.2.  ICW MCTM-UAE exercise coordinators, communicate\n with base/installation security to ensure all requirements for\nforeign visitor base access are satisfied.\n3.C.4.B.4.  MEFs are encouraged to align/incorporate UETs to \nexisting training events to reduce negative impacts to the \nFleet Marine Force and to address partnering and coalition \noperations mission essential tasks (MET).\n3.C.4.B.5.  When these resources are under MEF control, MEFs should\nprovide range control, ammunition storage, lodging, dining, and \nmedical support as required and identified during the \nUET/MTX/SLTE planning process.\n3.C.4.C.  Force sourcing challenges: \n3.C.4.C.1.  The authority to cancel a PG CONUS DFT sourcing\nrequirement is held by DC PP&O unless the cancellation is \nrequested by the UAE PG via MCTM-UAE. In the latter case, \nPP&O POC(S) may cancel the requirement in FMT and PP&O PLU will\ncommunicate cancellation to all force provider stakeholders. \n3.C.4.C.2. For the (2) annual UETs, one at CLNC and one at CPEN,\nif a Partnering Unit and/or an Exercise Implementation Unit cannot\nbe sourced during the PG requested dates, the intended supporting \nMARFOR/MEF, ICW MARCENT and MCTM-UAE, will identify alternate \nsupportable dates or request alternate supporting units from \nadjacent force providers to include MARFORRES and MARSOC.\n3.C.4.C.2.A.  If the PG cannot adjust to alternate dates made \navailable and no adjacent force provider support is available,\nthe intended supporting MARFOR/MEF Commander shall reclama the UET \nsourcing requirement from the MCBUL 3120 NLT 90 days prior to UET\nexecution. \n3.C.4.C.3.  For the (1) annual MTX and (1) annual SLTE integration,\nif a Partnering Unit and/or Exercise Implementation Unit cannot be \nsourced during the PG requested dates, MARCENT, ICW MCTM-UAE, will\nwork with force providers and exercise stakeholders to identify \nalternate dates, or alternate MTX/SLTE iterations that are \nsupportable for PG participation.   \n3.C.4.C.3.A. If no solution can be found, COMUSMARCENT shall request\ncancellation of PG participation in MTX or SLTE via AMHS to \nDC PP&O NLT 90 days prior to UET execution. \n3.C.4.D.  Additional or Detailed Support Requests to the \nAnnual Plan. \n3.C.4.D.1. After MARFOR/MEF acceptance of the Annual Plan, \nMARCENT will validate and forward subordinate or detailed support\nrequest from MCTM-UAE to MARFOR/MEF force providers, info PP&O PLU.\nPP&O PLU will interject only in the case of non-concurrence to \nrequested support. PP&O POC(S) will register MARCENT-validated,\ndetailed support requests in FMT.\n3.C.4.D.2. It is recommended that MARFORs and MEFs delegate DIRLAUTH\nbetween MARCENT, MCTM, and the intended supporting units for \ndetailed planning or additional support requests subordinate\nto the annual plan.\n3.C.4.D.3.  For additional, and/or MOS-specific support requests \nthat are deemed unsupportable by force providers, MCTM-UAE, ICW\nMARCENT, will consider the necessity of the support to successful\ncompletion of the DFT and determine if alternate training and \nexercise objectives can be accomplished.   \n3.C.4.E.  Planning cycle events for PG CONUS DFTs will be published\nvia AMHS or Enterprise Task Management Software Solution (ETMS2).\nIn the case of SLTE integration, PG CONUS DFT planning cycle \nevents will mirror set dates for Marine SLTE planning.  \n3.C.4.F.  MCTM-UAE will provide Foreign Disclosure oversight or\ncoordinate with CONUS FDOs to ensure products and briefs visible\nor provided to the UAE during planning cycle events or the \nexecution of training or exercises are Unclassified or cleared \nfor release to UAE.\n4.

This MARADMIN announces the Marine Corps\nRecruiting Command (MCRC) Recruiting Station (RS) preference\nincentive offered to FY27 recruiting duty volunteers. This incentive\nis part of a larger MCRC campaign, Recruit the Recruiter (RtR),\ndesigned to increase volunteerism and reduce the size of the \nHeadquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) Special Duty Assignment Screening \nTeam (HSST) requirement. This is a collaborative effort between MCRC\nand Manpower & Reserve Affairs (M&RA), Director, Manpower Management\nDivision (MM).\n2. The Recruiting Station Incentive (RSI) allows Marines to choose\ntheir preferred RS, based on availability, when they volunteer and \ncomplete the request with the unit career counselor.\n3. Per ref A, qualified Marines who volunteer during the above\nlisted timeline are guaranteed his/her available RS of choice and a \nFY27 school seat at Marine Corps Recruiter School.\n4. Per ref A, Marines who volunteer for and successfully complete a \ntour of duty as a recruiter will be given a contiguous United States\nassignment of geographical preference unless they specifically\nrequest an overseas assignment. These Marines are authorized a duty\nstation option to a specific geographic area. Every effort will be\nmade to satisfy the desires of the Marine when a valid billet in\ntheir primary military occupational specialty (PMOS) exists in the\nrequested geographic area.\n5. Second Tour Recruiters are not eligible for RSI's, all second\ntour Recruiters will obtain a By Name Request (BNR) before submission \nof their volunteer package due to receiving orders directly back onto\nthe duty. Orders will be issued by the Recruiting Monitor to that\nspecific RS. These Marines are directed to contact the Recruiting\nMonitor for second-tour submission inquiries.\n6.

The Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and \nSecurity (OUSD(I&S)) based on OUSD(I&S) memorandum 25 Aug 23, highly \nencourages intelligence leaders to enable, to the extent authorized \nby applicable personnel laws and regulations, up to 8 hours of duty \ntime during the regularly scheduled work week for civilian employees \nenrolled in the NIU part-time programs to attend classes during duty \nhours. Such accommodations may be considered for both full- and \npart-time employees, being mindful of our hours-of-work and premium \npay policies. Similar consideration should be afforded to active-\nduty Marines, to the extent consistent with mission requirements and \nservice-specific regulations but must be approved by the first O-5 \nin the applicant\u2019s change of command.\n10. This Marine administrative message is applicable to Active and \nReserve Marines & Marine Corps Civilians that meet the stated \nprogram requirements.  \n11.

Purpose: This message outlines the process for \nhandling government-issued Personal Identity Verification (PIV) \ncompliance ID cards (Common Access Cards - CAC), logical access \ntokens (DOD-issued Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates), \nand other multi-factor authentication tokens provided to personnel \nin both the original and Department of Defense (DOD) reopened \nversions of the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP). This process \nincludes the deactivation and return of these credentials to ensure \ncompliance with federal regulations and maintain access to \ngovernment benefits and resources during the personnel\u2019s transition \nperiod. Additionally, this message provides guidance on managing \nMarine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) access and accounts (both \nMCEN-N (unclassified) and MCEN-S (classified)) for civilian \npersonnel in the DRP.\n2. Situation\n2.a. Background. The DRP allows eligible personnel to resign from \nservice while maintaining their affiliation with the Department of \nDefense (DoD) until their official end-of-service date or 30 \nSeptember 2025, whichever comes first. During this transition \nperiod, personnel retain their DoD affiliation, including access to \ncertain benefits and privileges. However, all personnel in this \nprogram must adhere to DoD regulations, including those governing \nthe management of government-issued credentials.\n2.b. As DRP-approved Marine Corps civilians transition out of \ngovernment service, all associated authorized and privileged logical \naccess, including access to the Marine Corps Enterprise Network \n(MCEN) and related user accounts, must be revoked. Failure to \npromptly disable and remove these accounts poses cybersecurity risks \nand incurs unnecessary financial costs.\n3. Action\n3.a. Personal Identity Verification (PIV) compliance ID cards \n(Common Access Cards - CAC).\n3.b. DRP Personnel will retain their CAC as a DOD affiliate for \nidentity proofing for benefits per reference (a) until their \nofficial end of service or 30 September 2025, whichever occurs \nfirst. \n3.c. At end of service, DRP personnel are responsible to return the \nCAC to nearest RAPIDS site in person or via mail. RAPIDS site \ninformation may be found at Identity Card Office Online (IDCO) \nhttps:(slash)(slash)idco.dmdc.osd.mil/idco.\n3.d. During the delayed resignation period, all management of the \nCAC, to include re-issuance and replacement, will follow the policy \noutlined in reference (a). \n3.e. Marine Corps Logical Access Tokens and Multi-functional \nAuthentication (MFA) Devices.\n3.f. DRP Personnel will surrender at checkout of command all Service \nissued logical access only (non-CAC) credentials including, but not \nlimited, to Alternate Logon Tokens (AltToken), NIPRNET Enterprise \nAlternate Logon System (NEATS) Tokens, SIPRNET Tokens (SIPRToken) \nand Yubikeys in accordance with reference (b).\n3.g. At the end of the service, DRP personnel retain any \nauthentication credentials associated with non-civilian personnel \ncategories, such as DSLogon, which are used for logical access only.\n3.h. Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) Access and Accounts \n(MCEN-N and MCEN-S):\n3.i. In accordance with reference (c), no later than 24 hours after \ncompleting DRP out-processing from associated Marine Corps Commands, \nor immediately for personnel who have already departed, all Marine \nCorps Commands and organizations must take the following actions for \ncivilian personnel under their authority who are approved for the \nDRP and departing active service:\n3.j. Account Disablement Request. For each civilian employee \ndeparting under the DRP, the owning Marine Corps Commands and \norganizations will submit a separate MCEN-N Remedy Change User \nService Request for each NIPRNet and SIPRNet authorized and \nprivileged user account. The employee\u2019s DRP Final Separation \nAgreement must be uploaded to the user\u2019s Remedy People Record \nalongside the service request for auditing purposes.\n3.k. Account Disablement. Using the justification reason of \"EAS \n(End of Active Service),\" set the EAS value to the date when the \nemployee begins Administrative Leave, as specified in the DRP Final \nSeparation Agreement.\n3.l. Extension Attribute 12 (EA12) Designator Assignment. Modify the \nuser\u2019s Active Directory Extension Attribute 12 (EA12) to \"Designator \n1\" (Legal/Medical/FOIA Hold), in accordance with reference (d).\n3.m. Account Expiration Set the account expiration date to the final \ndate of service (for example, 30 September 2025, or an alternate \nretirement date).\n3.n. Account Detail Entry.

This MARADMIN provides Marines, civilians \nserving with Marines, and their families conducting a Permanent \nChange of Station (PCS) move from the issue date of this MARADMIN \nthrough the peak moving season (15 May through 31 August 2025) and \nbeyond with information on how to ship and store personal property \nand execute government travel as effectively and efficiently as \npossible using the Defense Transportation System, Defense Personal \nProperty System (DPS) or the Global Household Goods Contract's (GHC)\nMilmove and HomeSafe Connect.  Personal property is defined as \nhousehold goods (HHG), unaccompanied baggage (UB), mobile homes and\nprivately owned vehicles (POVs).  This peak moving season will be a\nblended or \"hybrid\" peak moving season while the deployment of the\nGHC continues throughout the Continental United Sates (CONUS).  Many\nof the processes identified for DPS are very similar for the GHC \nMilMove system and will be annotated DPS/GHC at the beginning of the \nparagraph.  Otherwise, note the differences as they apply to each \nsystem as DPS, DPS/GHC or GHC for paragraphs 1 through 6.  Please \nnote that civilian PCS entitlements and allowances are similar with \ncertain exceptions for weight allowance (18k pounds), number of days \nauthorized for Storage in Transit and personally procured moves must \nbe listed in the orders as a move option.  This MARADMIN speaks to \nthose processes that are commonly reflected between the two groups \nof movers (uniformed service members and civilian employees).\n1.a.  Commanders at all levels will ensure every Marine with PCS \nOrders is provided a copy of this MARADMIN.    \n1.b.  The Global Household Goods Contract (GHC) was awarded to \nHomeSafe Alliance LLC (HomeSafe) and is replacing the legacy \ntender-based program under the DPS.   Service members expressed \nconcerns regarding the previous relocation program. To address these \nconcerns, the chosen solution involves utilizing a single move \nmanager.  The GHC is a federal contract, and the requirements of a \nfederal contract implementing a moving program are significantly \ndifferent than requirements associated with the legacy program using \nDPS.  The contract has been deployed since 1 April 2024, from local \nmoves at selected sites to almost all installations in CONUS being \nactivated under the GHC.  To provide additional information on the \nGHC, please access the following link to better understand the \ncontract, why it was created and the intended benefits of its use: \nhttps(slash)(slash)www.militaryonesource.mil/resources/\nmillife-guides/ustranscom-global-household-goods-contract/.  \n1.c.  U.S. Transportation Command's J9 Defense Personal Property \nProgram Management Office (USTC J9 DPMO) manages the Personal \nProperty Program for the DoD and USTC Acquisition (TCAQ) manages the \nContract.  GHC uses the MilMove system to create a move request, \nverify requirements with service members and civilian employees, and \nperform government required operations to order shipment services \nfrom the Contractor, HomeSafe.  HomeSafe uses their system, \nHomeSafeConnect, to coordinate with individual service members and \ncivilian employees to move shipments.  The GHC continues to be \nrolled out over the next several months and some moves will remain \nin the legacy system DPS.  Please note that all Outside the \nContinental United States (OCONUS) moves will continue to use the \nlegacy DPS until after Peak Moving Season 2025 (around the end of \nAugust/early September) and then will begin phasing CONUS to OCONUS, \nOCONUS to OCONUS and OCONUS to CONUS shipments to the GHC.  The \nresponses provided in the questionnaire/shipment sort tool located \non the DPS Landing Page as detailed in paragraph three (3) will \ndetermine which move system a Marine will use. \n1.d.  GHC does not currently support Non-temporary Storage (NTS) \nshipments, POV Shipments and Mobile Home shipments.  These \nrequirements will be performed using DPS and the PCSMYPOV.com \nwebsite until further notice by USTC J9 DPMO.  The DPS Landing Page \nsort tool in paragraph 3 will be updated to reflect these additional \ncapabilities in the future.  Ref (a) provides two sets of \nregulations supporting legacy DPS and GHC contract processes and \nprocedures and are identified as Part IV-A DPS/ETOPS and Part IV-B \nMilMove (GHC). \n2.  Issues with Marine's CONUS PCS HHG Move DPS/GHC\n2.a.  As with any PCS move there may be issues with shipment \nsupport.  Regardless of which HHG move system (legacy DPS or GHC \nMilMove) is used, when issues arise such as missed pack start dates, \nmissed pickup dates, missed delivery dates, or other issues \nincluding communication with the moving company or representative \nassigned to the Marine's move, use the following procedures to reach \nout for assistance:\n2.a.(1).  Contact the Point of Contact (POC) at the moving company/\nlocal agent/customer support representative assigned to the move \nand request an update on the specific issue.  For GHC moves, contact \n(904) 567-6033.\n2.a.(2).  Should the respective POC not resolve the concerns, and \nthe Marine is located on a Marine Corps installation, immediately \nnotify the Distribution Management Office, Personal Property Office, \nQuality Assurance Section.  When not located on a Marine Corps \ninstallation, immediately notify the nearest Transportation Office, \nask for the Personal Property Office, and ask for the Quality \nAssurance Section to report the issue.  The phone numbers of the \nQuality Assurance Section at origin and destination are provided \nduring counseling.  When not located at a DoD installation such as \non recruiting duty, Inspector-Instructor duty or other assignment, \ncontact the Quality Assurance phone number provided during \ncounseling or the official USMC Personal Property mailbox at \nusmcpersonalproperty@usmc.mil and provide the DPS Bill of Lading \nNumber or MilMove Move Number, state the exact move issue, POC \ninformation of the company representative, Marine's POC information \nincluding phone number and any additional info related to the move, \nand a Personal Property Team Member will contact the Marine as \nquickly as possible.\n2.a.(3).  Marines should document all communication with TSPs or the \nContractor (HomeSafe) to ensure they can refer to notes and email \nshould there be an issue with the move.  \n3.  Initial Steps to Plan and Execute the PCS Move DPS/GHC\n3.a.  Personal Property Shipment and Storage Requirements.  Once \nnotification is received that PCS orders are forthcoming or already \nin hand, Marines MUST use the following options to access the DPS \nLanding Page to coordinate their move as ALL SHIPMENTS must be \ncoordinated using the DPS Landing Page.   Even if the Marine already \nhas a DPS account, the Marine MUST use the instructions below to get \nto the DPS Landing Page and follow the instructions from there.\n3.b.  Option one: Navigate to the DPS Landing page by following this \nlink: https:(slash)(slash)dps.move.mil/cust/standard/user/home.xhtml.  \nOnce on the DPS Landing Page, the Marine will accept the Security \nbanner instructions, then scroll down to DPS LOGIN OPTIONS and see \nthe \"CUSTOMER (I need to ship personal property)\" tool called the \n\"Sort Tool\".  The Sort Tool is designed to sort applications between \nDPS and GHC.  Once at the \"Sort Tool\" Marines must follow the \ninstructions as a \"CUSTOMER (I need to ship personal property).\"  \nAccurate responses to the questions will ensure Marines are routed \nto the correct system.  Marines must enter correct email addresses \nto facilitate communications throughout the application and \nonboarding process.  Use ONLY commercial/personal email addresses \non the application(s) for communication, especially for those \nMarines separating or retiring.  DO NOT use your @usmc.mil address.\n3.c.  Option 2: While the DPS link above is the best method to \naccess the DPS Landing Page, Marines may also use the Military One \nSource website at www.militaryonesource.mil/moving-pcs/\nmoving-personal-property and click on LOGIN TO DPS to reach the DPS \nLanding Page.\n3.d.  For those that choose the Military One Source website, scroll \ndown the page and explore the various links and tabs to learn how \nthe generic move process works.  Locate the supporting Personal \nProperty Processing Office (PPPO)/Installation Transportation \nOffice (ITO), determine the weight of household goods, receive \ninitial personal property entitlement and allowance information, \nreview POV shipment and storage instructions, review instructions on \nclaim filing, and much more.\n3.e.  If technical issues arise with the DPS Landing Page, contact \nthe System Response Center for assistance at 800.462.2176 or email \nat usarmy.scott.sddc.mbx.g6-src-dps-hd@army.mil.\n4.  Counseling requirements and system selections/considerations \napplies to DPS/GHC.\n4.a.  Marines conducting their first move, Marines separating or \nretiring, and Marines moving a mobile home must receive additional \ncounseling because of varying entitlements.  Visit/contact your \nlocal PPPO before submitting the shipment application to learn about \nyour shipping requirements and entitlements.\n4.b.  Marines will perform self-counseling using the DPS Landing \nPage instructions provided in paragraph 3 for DPS shipments or will \nbe provided separate counseling instructions by the Personal \nProperty Office for GHC MilMove supporting the installation/the \nnearest installation.  \n4.b.(1).  Marines using DPS to manage their shipment are encouraged \nto take notes on entitlements, allowances, and procedures during \ncounseling.  Once complete with reviewing the counseling \ninformation, upload the required documents such as PCS Orders and \nendorsements, and note any questions not covered by DPS Counseling.  \nThe next step is to contact or visit the nearest installation PPPO \nto receive targeted counseling on questions noted during DPS \ncounseling and submit any additional documents, including documents \nfor a Personally Procured Move (PPM) and/or to complete shipment or \nstorage for a POV.\n4.b.(2).  Marines directed to use MilMove must follow the \ninstructions to create an account and follow through with the \nprocess requirements.  Personnel without a CAC, such as separatees \nor retirees, contact the nearest Personal Property Office or \nusmcpersonalproperty@usmc.mil for instructions.  Personal Property \nOffice counselors will ensure each Marine is properly counseled.\n4.c.  Planning the Move Dates.  Marines MUST complete their \ncounseling and submit their requested pickup date as soon as \npossible after receipt of their orders, but not less than 90 days \nbefore their requested pickup date when possible.\n4.d.  Important dates to consider.  The most popular peak season \npickup dates (the peak of the peak season) are immediately following \nthe Memorial Day weekend through mid-July.  HHG moves in this 45-day \nwindow are difficult to schedule because of the high demand for \nshipments across the Department of Defense.  Therefore, the sooner \nan application is submitted, the sooner the requested pickup date \ncan be considered.  Also, be aware that the first two days and last \ntwo days of every month may be difficult to schedule as pickup dates \nbecause of the timing of rental and lease agreements.\n4.e.  Requested pickup dates are not confirmed until the \nTransportation Service Provider (TSP) or HomeSafe representative \ncontacts the Marine in writing via email with the confirmed pickup \ndate(s).  This sets the 7 Day Spread for Routine Shipments \n(described in paragraph 4.g.).  Should unexpected circumstances \nrequire a change to the pickup and or delivery dates, Marines \nshould be aware that new pickup and/or delivery dates that meet \ntheir needs may not be available.  Marines MUST contact their \nsupporting Personal Property Office/PPSO Outbound Shipment \nSection/Shipment Management Section immediately to attempt to \nschedule new pickup and/or delivery dates.\n4.f.  Marines may have multiple shipments, and a different company \nmay be assigned to each shipment, particularly for orders OCONUS.  \nPlease note, be careful to not overlap multiple shipment pickup and \ndelivery dates because (although unlikely) it could cause the wrong \nitems to be packed and placed in the wrong shipment.  If this \noccurs, a \"break-in\" cost will be charged to the Marine seeking to \nretrieve items.  To avoid those costs, schedule requested pickup \nand delivery dates accordingly and when possible, be sure to \nphysically separate different shipments for different locations.\n4.g.  The 7 Day Spread for Routine Shipments DPS/GHC. \n4.g.(1).  The 7 Day Spread for DPS/GHC shipments:  Marines will \nprovide a requested pickup date, which should be the last day the \nHHGs are ready for pickup.  The preceding six (6) calendar days \nbefore the requested pickup date will be set as the 7 Day Spread \nperiod.  The Marine will submit a preferred pickup date that must \nfall within the 7 Day Spread.  When the shipment is awarded to a \nTSP/GHC Contractor, the TSP/GHC Contractor may select the requested \npickup date, or the TSP/GHC Contractor may select any one of the \nother previous six (6) calendar days before the requested pickup \ndate to pick up the shipment.  The TSP/GHC Contractor must provide \nthe confirmed pickup date in writing via email to the Marine within \nthree (3) calendar days from the date the shipment was awarded.  \nThe Marine and TSP/GHC Contractor may negotiate the pickup date; \nhowever, the TSP must accommodate a pickup date within the \nspread-date window.  Once established, the pickup date cannot \nchange without the Marine's approval and notification by the Marine \nand the TSP/GHC Contractor of the approved date change to the \nPersonal Property Shipping Office (PPSO).  Weekends and holidays \nmay be part of the previous six (6) calendar days but are not \nnormally used for routine shipment pickup dates unless the Marine \nwants to be picked up on a weekend/holiday and the TSP/GHC \nContractor can accommodate this request. Weekend/holiday pickup \ndates must be approved by the Marine, the TSP/GHC Contractor, and \nthe PPSO that awarded the shipment to the TSP/GHC Contractor.  Note \nthat there may not be Government Quality Assurance personnel \navailable on weekends or holidays.  For Marines seeking to move on \na weekend or holiday, confirm Government Quality Assurance \npersonnel support with their local Personal Property Office before \nthe pickup date.  If the Marine cannot support the pickup date \nselected by the TSP/GHC Contractor, the Marine must immediately \ncontact the shipping office to explain why that date is not \nsupportable and request a different date.  For additional details \non the 7 Day Spread for Routine Shipments, Marines are encouraged \nto contact their local Personal Property Office.\n4.g.(2).  Note 1.  For planning purposes use 4,000 pounds of HHG \nweight as equal to one day of packing for DPS shipments.  Therefore, \n16,500 pounds of HHG weight equals up to five days of packing \nimmediately before the confirmed pickup date, unless those days are \nweekends or a holiday, in which case the packing on those dates \nmust be agreed to by the Marine, the TSP, and the PPSO that awarded \nthe shipment to the TSP.  The confirmed pickup date should drive \nall other dates needed to clear quarters and other requirements \nnecessary to execute the move.  In GHC, the packing days will be \ndetermined during the premove survey.  Once established, the pickup \ndate should not be changed unless it is necessary to make a change \ndue to unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the Marine \nbecause new pickup dates may not be available due to the high \nvolume of moves.  To estimate the weight for each shipment, use the \nauthorized weight estimator located at this link: \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dp3/weightestimator.cfm.  \nShort Fuse shipments are not eligible for the 7 Day Spread and will \nbe processed per paragraph 4.h. \n4.g.(3).  Note 2.  For DPS moves, information on the selected TSP \nis available at this website: https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil\n/dp3/tspinformation.cfm#tspdetail.  The Marine will provide the \nfour-digit Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC), which is assigned to \nevery TSP, to enable the search feature.  The SCAC will be \nidentified on the email from the PPSO that announces which TSP was \nawarded the shipment.  Select Sort by: \"SCAC\" and enter the TSP's \nSCAC to search for TSP ratings.  Almost every TSP will have at \nleast one Letter of Warning and/or Letter of Suspension which \nwill be identified on the TSP Metrics page.  When the Marine has \nquestions regarding the selected TSP, contact the PPSO at the phone \nnumber/email address provided on the shipment award email to \ndiscuss.\n4.g.(4).  Note 3.  Nontemporary Storage (NTS) shipment pickup date \nfrom the NTS facility is not affected by a 7 day spread.\n4.h.  Short Fuse shipments DPS/GHC.  A Short Fuse shipment is a \nshort notice PCS requirement when the Marine receives PCS Orders \nwith limited time between the orders issuance date and the \nEstimated Departure Date, such as \"10-day orders,\" and orders \nissued for various schools based on promotion dates, etc., that are \nbeyond the Marine's control.  In the rare cases when these short \nnotice situations arise, it is understandable that coordinating all \nthe elements for a PCS move can be overwhelming.  Commanders at all \nleadership levels are encouraged to allow the Marine the necessary \ntime to complete preparations for the move.  There are several \nchecklist tools available for a Marine requiring immediate support.  \nFurther, all Marines should plan the move as soon as possible and \ncomplete the counseling process accordingly.  In the event \ncircumstances beyond the control of the Marine (TAD, Formal Schools, \netc., and supported by documentation) prevent an early submission \nof the shipment application, or applications when OCONUS PCS Orders \nare issued, contact the local PPPO and inform them of the issues \nassociated with the delay in submitting the required application(s).  \nConfirmed pickup date(s) should drive all other dates needed to \nclear quarters and other requirements necessary to execute the move.  \nMarines should not wait until the last minute to submit their \nshipment applications as shipping capacity may not be available or \nwithin DPS, lesser quality moving companies may be the only moving \ncompanies available for the shipment.  When capacity is constrained, \nit is very important to manage the move and ensure details are \nclearly explained and supported by all involved.\n4.j.  Lithium Battery shipment and storage limitations DPS/GHC.  \nSince 15 May 2023, the moving company has been required to properly \npackage, label, and certify lithium-ion cells rated at 100 \nwatt-hours or less (20 watt-hours or less for a single  cell) and \nlithium metal batteries containing two (2) grams or less of \nlithium content (one (1) gram or less for single cells).  Questions \nregarding lithium batteries can be directed to the local PPO and \nshould be discussed in counseling sessions to ensure there are no \nviolations of this requirement.\n4.k.  Professional Books, Papers, and Equipment (PBP&E), aka \n\"Pro Gear\" DPS/GHC.  The maximum weight limit for Pro Gear for \nMarines of all ranks is 2,000 pounds.  Marines may request an \nadditional weight allowance up to 500 pounds for spouse Pro Gear \nrequired for employment or community support activities for their \nspouse (civilian employee spouses are not authorized a PBP&E weight \nallowance).  All Pro Gear requests must be submitted to the local \nPPPO for consideration before the move.  Ensure inventory items that \nare Pro Gear are weighed separately (bathroom scales are acceptable) \nto obtain a weight on each item.  Also, items designated as Pro Gear \non the inventory must be marked as M-PRO for the Service member or \nS-PRO for the spouse of the Service member.  See the Defense \nTransportation Regulation Part IV-A, Appendix K1 \"It's Your Move\" \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_part_iv_att_A\n-k_1.pdf for a list of items that qualify as Pro Gear.  For civilian \nemployees, see Appendix K2 \"It's Your Move\" \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_part_iv_att_A\n-k_2.pdf.\n4.l.  Additional Counseling and Contact Information DPS/GHC.  The \nofficial Marine Corps Facebook Page for Personal Property is located \nat www.facebook.com/usmchouseholdgoods.  The official Marine Corps \nFacebook Page for Passenger Travel is located at www.facebook.com/\nusmcpassengertravel.  LPD Public Page for PCS Move Resources related \nto Personal Property Shipment and Storage, Passenger Travel and \nother critical information is located at: https:(slash)(slash)www.\niandl.marines.mil/Divisions/Logistics-Division-LP/Logistics-\nDistribution-Policy-Branch-LPD/PCS-Move-Resources/.\n4.m.  Sailors assigned to Marine Corps units should also access the \nNavy Household Goods and Personal Property website at \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.navsup.navy.mil/NAVSUP-Household-Goods/Home/ \nfor Navy-specific entitlements, allowances and procedures.\n4.n.  Post Counseling and Follow-Up Actions Before the Move DPS/GHC.  \nA Personal Property Shipping Office representative may contact the \nMarine to confirm a certain element or elements of a shipment prior \nto awarding the shipment to a TSP/GHC Contractor.  Once the shipment \nis awarded, a pre-move survey will also be performed by the TSP/GHC \nContractor.  Further, the TSP/GHC Contractor may request the use of \nan electronic pre-move survey, using a cell phone with camera, to \nconduct the survey.  This method is authorized when approved by the \nMarine.\n4.o.  Personally Procured Move (PPM) DPS/GHC.  BE IN CONTROL OF THE \nMOVE.  PPMs are available in DPS and GHC MilMove and the Sort Tool \nwill provide which system is the correct method for the move.  PPMs \nare designed for the Marine to be their own moving company.  Most \nMarines will request a PPM to have more freedom when making \ndecisions regarding when the shipment will be picked up, how soon \nit will be transported to the destination and the delivery timeline.  \nUsing ANY moving company or services will tie the Marine to a \ncontract that may limit their options. There are several benefits to \nexecuting a PPM, especially during peak season: (1) Marines can \nchoose who (the Marine, a moving company, friends, family or \ncombination), when, and how to move their HHG, (2) potentially no \ndelays in receiving the HHG at destination, (3) Marines are in \ncharge of caring for their own HHG, and (4) potentially more money \nin the Marine's pocket based on how much work they do (sweat equity) \nto keep their costs low.  Note: PPM incentives are taxed for both \nFederal and State (when applicable).  Additionally, operating \nexpenses are not reimbursed dollar for dollar but are used to offset \nthe tax liability associated with the incentive.  \n4.o.1.  Marines can receive 100% of the Government's cost to move\nthe same weight (up to the maximum authorized weight allowance based\non rank and with or without dependents) from the authorized origin \nlocation to the authorized destination location in the PCS Orders.  \nMarines are authorized storage up to (90) days at a commercial \nstorage facility not to exceed the Government's cost to store the \nsame weight.  \n4.o.2.  Marines executing a PPM to Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. \nterritories and possessions must be counseled and documents properly \nprepared in DPS (in use for these moves only at this time) to ensure \nthey are advised of information particular to the destination, such \nas the requirement to verify the use of U.S. Flag vessels when the \nshipment is transiting over ocean.  \n4.o.3.  Marines performing a routine PCS must use their Government \nTravel Charge Card (GTCC) for all expenses related to a PPM.  As of \nthe date of publication of this MARADMIN DoD Civilians are not \nrestricted from using their GTCC for PCS moves.  Marines must also \nnotify their Agency Program Coordinator (APC) to adjust the credit \nlimits and PCS Mission Critical status to accommodate the required \nuse of the GTCC at least 10 days prior to departure to ensure the \nMarine has a maximum amount of time to submit and settle their PPM \nClaim.  The GTCC cannot be used for separation travel, to include \nPPMs in conjunction with separation travel of separatees and\nretirees.  For those Marines who do not possess a GTCC, an Advance\nOperating Allowance (AOA) \"may\" be authorized as an exception to\npolicy, however Marines who are using only their POV(s) to execute\na PPM are not eligible to receive an AOA.  \n4.o.4.  Marines must also provide empty and full weight tickets and \nsubmit their completed PPM Claim via Marine Online (MOL) and/or \nMilmove for GHC moves.  If MOL is not available, Marines may turn \nthe completed claim in to the Marine Corps installation Personal \nProperty Office at destination.  Make a complete copy of the PPM \nClaim before it is turned over for settlement regardless of which \nmethod is used.  Marines who receive an AOA must submit their PPM \nclaim for settlement within 45 days of receipt of the AOA.  Review \nthe PPM Claim settlement website at: https:(slash)(slash)www.logcom.\nmarines.mil/Marines/Personally-Procured-Move/ for the latest \ninformation on how to prepare and submit a PPM Claim in DPS or in \nGHC MilMove and the estimated processing time and payment dates for \nsettled PPM Claims.  Additional information on PPM processes and \nclaims settlement can be accessed using the link provided in \nparagraph 4.l.\n5.  Executing the Move DPS/GHC.  Pre-move preparations are fully \nexplained at this website \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.militaryonesource.mil/moving-housing/moving/\nmoving-resources/.  The residence or other pickup location must be \nready for the packers to begin their work. At origin, Marines may \nneed to contact the origin PPPO Quality Assurance Section, the TSP \nor the TSP;s local agent responsible for packing and picking up the \nshipment, to resolve any issues with the TSP crewmembers, loaders or \ndrivers.  Under GHC, the Marine should have received a notification \nthat the photos of each team member are loaded to the HomeSafe \nConnect application on their phone the day prior to the move.  At \ndestination, Marines may need to contact the destination PPPO \nQuality Assurance Section to resolve any issues with the TSP or the\nGHC Contractor crew. Origin PCS Counselors will annotate the contact \nphone numbers of both the Origin and Destination Quality Assurance \nSections in the Remarks Block of the DD FORM 1299, Application for \nShipment and/or Storage of Personal Property for DPS moves and with\nin MilMove for GHC moves. In the event the DD FORM 1299 is \nmisplaced, Marines may use \nhttps:(slash)(slash)installations.militaryonesource.mil/search?progr\nam-service=2/view-by=ALL to locate Quality Assurance Section phone \nnumbers.\n5.a.  Quality Assurance Inspections for all Shipments DPS/GHC.  \nPersonal Property Quality Assurance Inspectors are authorized to \ninspect all shipments at origin and destination, including PPM \nshipments, before and during packing/loading and unloading/\nunpacking. Also, weight scale operators on military installations\ncan inspect shipments at the scales to ensure only authorized\nhousehold goods are being weighed in accordance with ref (b), \nChapter 4.\n5.b.  During and After the Move (Completing the Customer\nSatisfaction Survey in stages) DPS/GHC.  Marines should complete the\nCustomer Satisfaction Survey within seven (7) calendar days after\nnotification that an element of the move is completed, such as \nCounseling, Origin Services, Destination Services and Claims. The\ncomments and scores given to each response for the services provided\ncontributes toward eliminating poor performers from the legacy DPS\nDefense Personal Property Program and ensures the best moving \ncompanies get the most shipments.  This survey also tells the \nGovernment how effectively the GHC contractor, HomeSafe, performed.\nRegardless of which move system is used, Marines MUST make their\nvoices heard by completing the Customer Satisfaction Survey as \ntheir move progresses to delivery and, when necessary, after claims\ncompletion.\n6.  Personal Property Claims DPS/GHC\n6.a.  Lost and Damage Claims.  For DPS and GHC shipment claims, \nplease visit the guide located at \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.militaryonesource.mil/moving- housing/moving\n/planning-your-move/file-a-claim-after-your-military-move/. For \nnon-DPS claims, such as contracted moves called Direct Procurement \nMethod moves, or if Marines still have questions on their DPS\nclaims, Marines should contact the Navy Personnel Claims Unit at\n(888) 897-8217, (757) 440-6315 (DSN 564) or email \nNorfolkClaims@us.navy.mil.  Marines have 180 days from the delivery\nof each shipment to identify additional lost or damaged items using\nthe after delivery form. Marines must also file their claim within 9\nmonths from the delivery date.  Marines are encouraged to complete\ntheir check of all delivered items as soon as possible after \ndelivery to ensure every item that is lost or damaged is clearly\nidentified to the delivery TSP within 180 days.  The 180 days after\ndelivery reporting time does not apply to shipments delivered using\nthe Direct Procurement Method (DPM) and local moves in the DPS\nprocess.   Such moves have 75 days from delivery date to identify\nloss or damage.  Note that the TSP maximum liability for each HHG\nshipment is 75,000 dollars, but Military Claims Offices can\ncompensate the difference between the TSP maximum and the\ndepreciated value for the remainder of the shipment items not\ncovered by the TSP maximum.  Marines who own high dollar items\nand/or the overall cost to replace the entire HHGs exceeds the \nTSP maximum may consider private insurance or verify with their \nhomeowner/rental property policy to determine coverage for HHGs when \nperforming a move.  A complete and accurate visual inventory of the \nMarine's personal property (photographic evidence) is key to \nsubmission and settlement of any lost and/or damage claim, whether \nfiled with the TSP/GHC HomeSafe or the Military Claims office.\n6.b.  Inconvenience Claims DPS/GHC.  When HHGs are not picked up or \ndelivered on the agreed upon dates, Marines may qualify to file an \nInconvenience Claim with the DPS TSP or the GHC Contractor.  \nShipments moved under the Direct Procurement Method (DPM) do not \nqualify for Inconvenience Claims as this time.  Unaccompanied \nBaggage delays may not be payable under DPS when the government is \nresponsible for the delay.  However, under the GHC contract, \nHomeSafe is responsible for inconvenience claims for ALL shipment \ntypes except PPMs when OCONUS shipment capabilities are deployed.  \nDownload the latest Inconvenience Claim Information Handout from the \nUSMC (slash) USTC Handouts and Brochures link identified in \nparagraph 11.a. of this MARADMIN.\n6.c.  Real Property (Residence) Damage Claims DPS/GHC.  When a \nTSP/GHC Contractor damages the residence in any way, Marines may be \nable to submit a Real Property Damage Claim to the TSP/GHC HomeSafe.  \nThere is a seven (7) calendar day limit to notify the TSP of the \ndamage to the residence and the TSP must determine repair estimate \nwithin 15 days of notification of the damage.  To meet deadlines and \nPCS on time, Marines must be proactive with photographs and \nnotifications to the TSP/GHC HomeSafe regarding these damages.\n7.  OCONUS Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) Shipment and Storage\n7.a.  The National Defense Authorization Act of 2025 authorizes two\nPOVs for shipment/storage for uniformed Service members.  However,\nuntil the entitlement is published in the Joint Travel Regulations,\nref (c), by the Per Diem, Travel, and Transportation Allowance\nCommittee, only one POV is authorized shipment at government expense\nand only under certain conditions.  This MARADMIN refers to the\ncurrent entitlements in effect on the date of publication.  Marines\nconducting a PCS move to, from or between OCONUS locations may be\nentitled to ship or store one POV at government expense.  Contact\nthe local PPPO for information regarding POV entitlements based on\nthe OCONUS destination and prepare required documents needed to ship\nor store the POV.  Generally, a POV that cannot be shipped OCONUS\nbecause of a country restriction is authorized storage and may be\nstored in government contracted facilities or stored by the Marine\nin self-procured POV storage.  Regardless of the method, storage\nmust be approved in advance by the PPPO.  The reimbursable monthly\nstorage rate for self-procured POV storage is based on the monthly\nPOV storage rate paid by the Government to the Global POV Contractor\n(GPC) International Auto Logistics (IAL).  Prior to the issuance of\nthis current contract on 1 October 2024, rates changed annually.\nThe monthly storage rate for reimbursement is stable throughout the\nlife of the current contract so contact your local Personal Property\nOffice for the current monthly storage rate in effect from 1 October\n2024 until a new contract is issued, or a renegotiated change is\nin effect. \n7.b.  Marines must use www.pcsmypov.com to make an appointment for \nPOV drop-off or pick-up at government provided storage facilities.  \nDuring peak season, demand is high for appointments so make them as \nsoon as possible once orders are received.  Marines remaining OCONUS \nwith new orders must provide them to the GPC to ensure continuation \nof storage at Government expense.\n  \n7.c. Marines must prove to the PPPO Counselor and the Vehicle \nProcessing Center (VPC) that all safety recall repairs have been \nperformed on the POV prior to turning in the POV for shipment or \nstorage. Self-procured POV storage businesses may not require the \nsafety recall repairs to be completed prior to placement in storage, \nbut Marines should complete them upon notification by the \nmanufacturer per the instructions in the notification document. \n7.d. Late Arrival at Destination.  Ref (c), par. 0534 provides the \ncurrent reimbursement rate.  As of 1 February 2025, when a POV is \ndelayed at destination, the Marine rates reimbursement for the cost \nof a rental vehicle for the Marine or their dependent\u2019s use at $30 \nper day (one POV only) for a maximum of $210.\n7.e.  For information on how to prepare a POV for shipment or \nstorage, review the documents Shipping Your POV, Appendix K3 and \nStoring Your POV, Appendix K4 of the Defense Transportation \nRegulation, Part IV, Personal Property, System A at \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_part_iv_app_k\n_3.pdf and https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_\npart_iv_app_k_4.pdf.\n7.f.  Note that POVs will not be picked up for shipment from a \ncommercial storage facility or any other location that is not under \nthe control of the Global POV Contractor without the POV\u2019s owner or \na person authorized by the owner with Power of Attorney (POA) onsite \nfor the pickup.  A copy of the POA, when used, must be provided as \npart of the shipment request.  The Marine/person with a POA MUST BE \nPRESENT when the contractor arrives.  The Marine will be charged for \na missed pickup fee due to the Marine\u2019s failure or the person with a \nPOA\u2019s failure to execute the pickup on the provided date and time.  \nThere are NO exceptions to this requirement.\n8.  Overseas Moves (OCONUS) Travel Preparations/Overseas Screening \nand HHG Shipments.  Overseas Suitability Screening (OSS) and OCONUS \ncounseling.  The overseas screening process may take up to 60 days \nor more; therefore, Marines shall commence overseas screening \nimmediately upon receipt of orders.  In order to ensure the Marine \nreports to the overseas station by the required date, the importance \nof complete and timely screening cannot be over-emphasized.  Each \nMarine MUST immediately initiate OSS through a Military Medical \nTreatment Facility for all dependents authorized to accompany the \nMarine to ensure suitability for OCONUS assignments.  In the \nmeantime, Marines should continue to plan to execute their HHG \nshipment pickup dates while this process is occurring.  In the event \nthe orders are modified or canceled, Marines MUST notify the PPSO \nimmediately for further instructions.  Additional OCONUS counseling \ninformation is also available at \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.militaryonesource.mil/moving-housing/moving/\nmoving-resources/ and the links in paragraph 4.l. of this MARADMIN.\n9.   Travel Compliance/Marines Traveling Accompanied with Dependents\n9.a.  Travel Compliance.  Each traveler is responsible to ensure \nthey comply with all travel requirements prior to the departure date \nfrom the airport for a commercial flight or from the Aerial Port of \nEmbarkation for Air Mobility Command \u2013 Patriot Express (AMC-PE) \nflights.  Marines should maintain all receipts during travel as many \nexpenses are reimbursable.  Marines should contact their supporting \nInstallation Personnel Administration Center or Disbursing Office\nfor more information regarding travel allowances and reimbursement \nprocesses.  Civilian Marines should contact their supporting Human \nResources Office for such information.  \n9.b.  U.S. Marine Corps PCS Advocacy Council (UPAC, volunteer \nspouses of Marines) and DC, I&L (LPD) and MCICOM G4 DMO prepared\nvery detailed checklists for Marines executing a PCS to Japan,\nHawaii, and within CONUS that covers everything from travel and\npassports to scheduling moves and settling claims, plus many \nadditional steps needed to execute a PCS with and without\ndependents.  The checklists can be downloaded by visiting the LPD\nPublic Page for PCS Move Resources website.  Information on UPAC\nsupport is also provided on the website: \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.iandl.marines.mil/Divisions/Logistics-\nDivision-LP/Logistics-Distribution-Policy-Branch-LPD/PCS-Move-\nResources/.\n9.c.  Marines should coordinate with the receiving \ncommand-designated sponsor and the Housing Office to determine \navailability of on-base housing.  To obtain the latest status of \navailable housing on Okinawa, Japan contact Housing at DSN \n315-634-0582 or kadenahousing.customerservice@us.af.mil.\n9.d.  Special Issuance Passports (SIP) and Visas.  SIPs and Visas\nmay be required for Marines, civilians, and their dependents\nwhenever they travel to OCONUS locations.  Ref (d) provides the\nrequirements necessary for entry into a particular country and can\nbe accessed for personnel with a Common Access Card (CAC) at link:  \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg.cfm.  *NOTE: Official \nOrders should also state passport requirements.  When SIPs/visas are \nrequired, applications must be prepared and submitted to a DoD \nPassport Agent as soon as possible due to an 8\u201311-week application \nprocessing period.  DoD Passport Agents may be located within the \nDMO Passenger Travel Office or other locations aboard the \ninstallation.\n10.  Baggage on Commercial and Government Contracted Carrier.  \nMarines executing PCS travel on a commercial or government \ncontracted carrier, via aircraft, ship, train, or bus, are \nauthorized reimbursement for no more than two (2) bags, 70 pounds or \nless each, not to exceed 62 linear inches (sum of length plus width \nplus height) plus a small carry-on per reserved seat.  Excess\nbaggage is defined as all baggage more than this quantity, weight,\nand/or size.  Excess baggage will not be authorized prior to a\nMarine's departure.   A Marine is subject to the commercial carrier's \nestablished baggage restrictions and fee schedules and is required \nto pay the commercial carrier in accordance with the carrier's fee \nschedule.  A Marine may submit for reimbursement via their PCS travel \nclaim for baggage fee expenses when their baggage does not exceed \ntwo checked bags, not to exceed 70 pounds, per authorized traveler.  \nRequests for reimbursement of excess baggage may be submitted to \nMMIB-3 after PCS travel has been completed if the contents of the \nbaggage was necessary at the future permanent duty station (PDS) \nprior to the arrival of the UB shipment and the items were not \navailable at the future PDS.  For further information, contact the \nlocal Passenger Travel Office (PTO) or see the AMC-PE Travel Page at \nlink:  https:(slash)(slash)www.amc.af.mil/AMC-Travel-Site/.\n11.  Transporting Pets\n11.a.  The key to a successful pet move is early planning and \nconstant follow- through.  Marines who are being reassigned to, from \nor between OCONUS locations are encouraged to immediately visit \ntheir local PTO located within the DMO to establish transportation \nrequirements for their pets.  Be aware it may take up to six months \nto complete all the requirements for ensuring pet(s) can be imported \nto an OCONUS location.\n11.b.  PCS orders are NOT required to submit reservations for PCS \ntravelers and pets (dogs and cats only) on AMC-PE nor do pets have \nto be cited within the orders for reimbursement purposes.  Because \npet reservations will be apportioned on a first come/first served \nbasis, pet transportation needs should be identified to the local \nPTO as soon as the Marine has a general idea of the required \ndeparture month.  Reservations will be finalized when AMC schedules \nthe flight on/about 90 days prior to the flight departure date.  At \nthat time, pet space requests will be submitted by the PTO.  However, \nbecause of limited space on the AMC-PE and the flight is available \nto members of all Services, there is no guarantee of a pet \nreservation no matter how early a Marine registers a pet movement \nrequirement.  Once the Marine completes the PCS Outbound Interview \nlocated in Marine Online (MOL), follow up with the PTO is required \nto finalize all pet travel arrangements.\n11.b.(1).  A Service member on a PCS order with an effective date of \nJanuary 1, 2024, or later, as defined in ref (c), paragraph 050107, \nmay be authorized reimbursement for the costs related to the \nrelocation of one household pet that arises from a permanent change \nof station.  A household pet is a cat or a dog, owned for personal \ncompanionship.  A Service member is responsible for compliance with \nall rules for importing and exporting a pet to and from the United \nStates to be eligible for reimbursement.  Denial of entry for the \npet could result in denial of reimbursement for pet transport \nexpenses.  Reimbursement for the actual cost of authorized pet \nrelated transportation expenses is limited to $550 per CONUS PCS \nmove and $2,000 per OCONUS PCS move.  A Service member may be \nauthorized the reasonable and substantiated cost of mandatory \nmicrochipping, quarantine fees, boarding fees, hotel service charges, \nlicensing fees at the new PDS, testing titer levels for entry, and \npet shipping fees if the member flies rather than drives, or the pet \nis shipped separately from the member.  For transoceanic travel, use \nof Government or Government procured transportation must be used if \navailable or reimbursement for transportation costs is not\n authorized.  In extenuating circumstances where both Patriot \nExpress capacity and regularly scheduled commercial airline service \nare not available for pets, the Secretarial Process may approve pet \ntransportation expenses that exceed $2,000 for an OCONUS PCS, not to \nexceed $4,000, for a Service member that departs a permanent duty \nstation listed in JTR supplement AP-PQ-02 at link: \nwww.travel.dod.mil/Portals/119/Documents/JTR/Supplements/pet_\nallowance_locations.pdf. This authority became effective November \n25, 2024.  Requests for Secretarial Process for this supplement may \nbe submitted via AA Form with supporting documentation and command \nendorsement to CMC (M&RA, MPO-40) via SMB_HQMC_MPO@USMC.MIL for \nconsideration.\n11.b.(2).  Transportation of a Pet to or from an Alternate Location \nor a Designated Place Effective 1 April 2025 \n11.b.(2).(a).  Alternate Location. Transportation of a pet to an \nalternate location may be authorized if a member with or without \ndependents owns a pet and receives PCS orders to a PDS where \nGovernment quarters rules prohibit the possession of a pet, a \nparticular breed that the Service member owns is prohibited from \nbeing transported to the new PDS, or airline policy prohibits the \ntransportation of the pet due to breed or other factors.  \nTransportation of the pet from the alternate location may be \nauthorized upon the member's receipt of new PCS orders.  \nTransportation of a pet to an alternate location may be authorized \nin the case of a member's death. \n11.b.(2).(b) Designated Place. Transportation of a pet may be \nauthorized to accompany dependents to a designated place when a \nService member receives PCS orders to serve an unaccompanied or \ndependent restricted tour, or to an assignment specified as unusually \narduous sea duty, or in the case of an early return of dependents at \nGovernment expense. Transportation of the pet from the designated \nplace may be authorized upon the member's receipt of new PCS orders.\n11.b.(3).  The government contracted AMC-PE rotator flights offer a \ndiscounted rate (ranging from 125 dollars to 375 dollars depending \non pet weight) to transport pets.  However, the number of pet spaces \nper flight is very limited.  The maximum weight allowed for a \ncombined pet and kennel is 150 pounds, which cannot be waived.  \nMarines are responsible for obtaining an authorized kennel/carrier \nbolted with metal nuts/bolts that provides adequate ventilation and \nample space for safe pet movement.  Soft-sided pet kennels/carriers \nmay be accepted for in-cabin movement only.  See the AMC Pet Travel \nInformation Page at \nhttps:(slash)(slash) www.amc.af.mil/AMC-Travel-Site/AMC-Pet-Travel-\nPage/ then click on AMC Pet Pamphlet 20 October 2023 or later date \nwhen updated on the website.\n11.c.  Emotional Support Animals and Service Animals.  The U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation revised its Air Carrier Access Act \n(ACAA) regulation on the transportation of Service Animals by air.  \nThis final rule defines a Service Animal as a dog, regardless of \nbreed or type, that is individually trained for the benefit of a \nqualified individual.  It allows airlines to recognize Emotional \nSupport Animals as pets, rather than Service Animals, and permits \nairlines to limit the number of Service Animals that one passenger \ncan bring onboard an aircraft to two Service Animals.  Please find \nmore information concerning this matter at: \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-\ndepartment-transportation-announces-final-rule-traveling-air-\nservice-animals.  Review the procedures for Service Animals \ncurrently posted on the AMC Travel Page or contact the local PTO for \nthe current policy related to Service Animals and AMC-PE \ntransportation.\n11.d.  Other Options for Moving Pets.  Marines should research all \nmethods as early as possible to select the overall best \ntransportation methods for their pets, including quarantine \nrequirements and costs (Germany, Hawaii, Japan, Korea and Guam).  \nOptions include services offered by regularly scheduled commercial \nairlines, including both US and Foreign Flag-carriers (NOTE: Marines \ncannot legally be reimbursed if using a Foreign Flag carrier for \ntransport of your pet), and dedicated pet relocation services.  \nRegardless of the method, all pets traveling to or returning from \nOCONUS require a health certificate from a certified veterinarian.  \nThe animal health screening process may include several visits to \nthe veterinarian, a quarantine period, and shots which may take at \nleast six months prior to the expected travel date to complete.  The \nfollowing website provides helpful information and guidelines to \nconsider when traveling with a pet followed by direct links to each \nof the City Pair Program's participating airline carrier's pet and \nservice animal policy: \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/transportation-\nairfare-pov-etc/airfare-rates-city-pairs-programs/resource-library/\nairline-pet-policy.\n11.e.  Non-Availability. If Government transportation is directed, \nbut not available, the traveler must provide a statement from the \nTraffic Management Office (TMO) or Installation Transportation \nOffice (ITO) that Government transportation is not available.  \nWhen traveling by POV, such as to or from Alaska, a non-availability \nstatement is not required.\n11.f.  For further pet transportation assistance, contact the local \nPTO, located in the DMO at Marine Corps installations, and within \nInstallation Transportation Offices DoD-wide, or visit the official \nMarine Corps Passenger Travel Facebook page at \nwww.facebook.com/usmcpassengertravel and the LPD-2 Public Page at: \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.iandl.marines.mil/Divisions/Logistics-\nDivision-LP/Logistics-Distribution-Policy-Branch-LPD/PCS-Move-\nResources/.\n12.

Unit command chronologies are frequently requested \nin support of award submissions, as part of legal investigations, \nand to tell the Marine Corps story to Congress and the American \npublic.  They are used to support official research for HQMC, Marine \nunits, and Marine veterans pursuing Department of Veterans Affairs \nclaims.  The information they contain informs force design decisions \nand is the basis for unit lineage and honors determinations.  It is \nvital that these records provide references and documents concerning\nspecific events that would support these purposes.\n2.b.  In 2014, reference (d) announced the development and testing of \na Marine Corps Electronic Command Chronology Reporting System by the \nArchives Branch at the Library of the Marine Corps, however, this \nsystem was not implemented for use and command chronology submissions\nremain required for submission via email.\n3.

Unit commanders shall ensure a staff member is designated in \nwriting to perform the additional duty of Staff Historian IAW \nreference (a).\n3.c.  HD has prepared a staff historian/command chronology support\nwebpage containing details on command chronology preparation and \nsubmission as well as a sample. Link https:(slash)(slash)www.usmcu.\nedu/Research/Marine-Corps-History-Division/Information-for-Units/\nCommand-Chronology-Program/\n3.d.  HD shall maintain a report of command chronology submissions to\nprovide unit leaders with awareness on the status of their command \nchronologies.  This report shall be updated monthly and posted on the \ncommand chronology support webpage.\n3.e.

This message announces the \nCommand Retention Mission (CRM) for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26).\n2.  Background.  The Marine Corps achieved historic retention\nrates under the Fiscal Year 2025 CRM, exceeding aggregate \nmissions for both First Term Alignment Plan (FTAP) and career \nMarines. This success is attributed to leaders at every echelon who \nworked tirelessly to meet the Commandant's priorities and retain \nour best talent. With FY25 in hand, the Service seeks to \ncarry the momentum forward into the FY26 Enlisted Retention \nCampaign.  \n3.  Action.  The following Major Commands are assigned a CRM, \neffective through 30 September 2026: \nMarine Forces Command\nMarine Forces Pacific\nMarine Forces Reserve\nMarine Forces Cyberspace Command\nMarine Forces Special Operations Command\nI Marine Expeditionary Force\n1st Marine Division\n3d Marine Aircraft Wing\n1st Marine Logistics Group\nII Marine Expeditionary Force\n2d Marine Division\n2d Marine Aircraft Wing\n2d Marine Logistics Group\nIII Marine Expeditionary Force\n3d Marine Division\n1st Marine Aircraft Wing\n3d Marine Logistics Group\nMarine Corps Installations Command \u2013 East\nMarine Corps Installations Command \u2013 West\nMarine Corps Installations Command \u2013 Pacific\nMarine Corps Installations Command - NCR\nTraining & Education Command\nTraining Command\nMarine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego\nMarine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island\nMarine Air Ground Task Force Training Command\nMarine Corps Logistics Command\n3.a.  Although only Major Subordinate Commands (MSCs) are \ndirectly missioned by CMC (MM), commanders, staffs, and \nleaders at all levels are critical in influencing the retention \nof the best and most qualified Marines in order to sustain our \nwarfighting capabilities. \n3.b.  The assigned mission for FY26 will be released via \nthe Total Force Retention System (TFRS). \n4.  Coordinating Instructions\n4.a.  The mission assigned to each MSC is linked to the \nexecution of a reenlistment and is not considered fulfilled \nuntil each Marine accepts his or her contract. The assigned CRM \nis considered the minimum requirement; it is imperative that \nMSCs sustain retention efforts throughout the FY26 Enlisted \nRetention Campaign. \n4.b.  The FY26 CRM assigns by-PMOS and aggregate missions to \neach MSC for the FTAP and Subsequent \nTerm Alignment Plan (STAP). MSCs are also assigned a Direct \nAffiliation Program (DAP) mission. Assigned missions are based \non each MSC's eligible population. \n4.b.1.  The assigned by-PMOS mission identifies the FTAP and \nSTAP PMOSs which are historically the most challenging for \nretention. The mission reflects a proportional share of the \nboatspaces aligned with the proportion of the eligible PMOS \npopulation within each MSC. For example, if MSC A has \n20 percent of the eligible 0311 Marines, MSC A's mission \nwill be to fill 20 percent of the available boatspaces. \n4.b.2.  The assigned by-PMOS mission does not preclude MSCs \nfrom assigning units additional PMOS requirements based on \nneed.   \n4.b.3.  The aggregate mission is based on the overall \nretention goal and the MSC\u2019s eligible population. The Service \nwill need to reenlist 39.6 percent of the eligible FTAP \npopulation and 66.3 percent of the eligible STAP population \nto meet end-strength requirements for FY26.  \n4.b.4.  The aggregate DAP mission assigned to each MSC is based \nupon the overall Reserve Component retention goal and each \ncommand\u2019s eligible FY26 first term Marine population.\n4.c.  Marines executing a lateral move in conjunction with \nreenlistment will count as a reenlistment in the PMOS they \nlaterally move into. \n4.d.  Only Marines with an End of Current Contract (ECC) \nbetween 1 October 2025 and 30 September 2026 will count \ntowards the FY26 CRM. For DAP, this population includes\nofficers. Per reference (b), reenlistments secured since the \nstart of the FY26 retention campaign on 1 January 2025 will\ncount towards the CRM.\n4.e.  The Service\u2019s requirement is to fill every boatspace \nfor each FTAP and STAP PMOS with the highest quality Marine. \nIn some cases, the total assigned mission across all MSCs \nmay exceed the authorized boatspace requirement for a PMOS. \nIf a PMOS reaches 100 percent execution of available \nboatspaces, all commands will be relieved of their mission \nfor that PMOS regardless of whether or not they achieved \ntheir originally assigned mission. \n4.f.  Reenlistment credit for purposes of the CRM will be \napplied to the MSC where the Marine is assigned upon execution \nof the reenlistment. Missions may be adjusted on a case-by-case \nbasis to account for Marines who change commands and \nsubsequently reenlist. Commands will receive credit once an \napproved DAP request is accepted by the eligible Marine. \n5.  Subsequent updates to the CRM will be released as necessary.\n6.  Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, \nManpower Management Division.//"

    "content": "OPERATIONS SECURITY PRACTICES FOR WARFIGHTING\nDate Signed: 4/17/2025 | MARADMINS Number: 194/25\nMARADMINS : 194/25\nR 161945Z MAR 25\nMARADMIN 194/25\nMSGID/GENADMIN/CMC PPO WASHINGTON DC//\nSUBJ/OPERATIONS SECURITY PRACTICES FOR WARFIGHTING//\nREF/A/MCO 3070.2A/THE MARINE CORPS OPERATIONS SECURITY PROGRAM\nPOC/S. M. DOIN/CIV/PP&O/EMAIL: SARA.M.DOIN(AT)USMC.MIL//\nGENTEXT/REMARKS/ \n1. Purpose. In accordance with ref (A), to increase the overall \noperations security (OPSEC) awareness and effectiveness across \nthe force by combating complacency, increasing situational \nawareness of vulnerabilities, and underscoring best practices\nfor all Marines to keep in mind as they go about their\nwarfighting business. \n2. As we carry out our daily missions and modernize for the\nfuture operating environment under Force Design concepts, \nit is vital to remember that our success depends not only\non our strength and skill but also on our ability to protect\nthe integrity of our operations.  Operations security is an \nessential part of maintaining our tactical advantage, \nensuring mission success, safeguarding the safety of every \nMarine, and enables our contributions to the Joint Force.  \nWe must perform OPSEC with the same diligence as other operational\ntasks. \n3. OPSEC is everyone\u2019s responsibility.  Whether you're deployed\nin the field, stationed at home, or in transit, your actions can\nhave a direct impact on the security of our unilateral, Joint, \nand combined operations.  Discretion in what we share, \nwhere we share it, and with whom we share it is key to preventing\nadversaries from gaining valuable information.\n4. Key Principles to Remember:\na)      Know Your Critical Information:  Understand what information\nand indicators need protection from the Critical Information and\nIndicators List (CIIL); be vigilant in how you handle and safeguard \nthis information. Your OPSEC Program Manager is responsible for\npublishing your commander\u2019s CIIL.\nb)      Limit Communication:  Be mindful of conversations in public\nspaces, online platforms, and social media. A simple comment can \nprovide an enemy with a significant advantage. Adversaries \ncan correlate seeming disparate data together with advanced \ncomputing that can produce indicators of our activities.\nc)      Monitor Your Surroundings: Always be aware of your\nenvironment and potential threats.  This includes monitoring \ncommunication channels and ensuring that sensitive materials\nare not exposed. Foreign intelligence entities are employed, paid,\nand promoted based on their ability to collect USMC information \n\u2013 they are incentivized to steal information from you.\nd)      Report Suspicious Activity: Your reporting of OPSEC \nviolations and possible indicator exposures helps improve the \noperations security process and ultimately improves the USMC\u2019s \nability to conduct operations.                    \n5. Best Practices:\na)      Personal Cell Phones. Personal cell phones are a major\nvulnerability that adversaries targeting you and your unit can \nexploit while utilizing a foreign communications network, i.e. \nwhile operating overseas.  If your command authorizes you to take\nyour personal cell phone, protect your personal information through\nencryption and virtual private networks to reduce vulnerabilities.\nb)      Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Commercial GPS devices can\nbe spoofed since they lack military encryption, i.e. adversaries \nfalsify the GPS signal \u2013 putting you and your fellow Marines at risk\nduring a host of activities that require you to report your position\naccurately. Many civilian systems, like personal fitness devices, \ncollect, aggregate, and make your location data available for sale\nand exploitation. Recommend using only Marine Corps approved\nGPS devices. Remain proficient at using map and compass.\nc)      Geotagging. If you take a digital picture using a personal \nelectronic device, there is metadata associated with that picture.\nThe metadata includes, but is not limited to, the location where the\npicture was taken, the time, and other identity-related information, \nand is stored digitally on the file along with other amplifying \ninformation. Do not post personal pictures to social media that may \nreveal sensitive information about Marine Corps operations. \nA seemingly trivial picture taken while deployed, at an exercise,\nor aboard a military installation may reveal critical information\nto an adversary particularly when corroborated or compiled with \nother adversary collection means.\nd)      Pictures and Videos. Ensure you are aware of what is in the\nbackground of pictures and videos before releasing it on social \nmedia or to the public and ensure it is cleared through\nCommunication Strategy and Operations (COMMSTRAT), OPSEC and/or \nthe Foreign Disclosure Officer. Be especially careful when\ntaking pictures at military exercises. Maps, computer screens, \nsigns, etc. may reveal Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures \n(TTPs) or other critical information that may be useful to an\nadversary, especially when paired with other collection means.\nPictures are generally not authorized on military \ninstallations or during operations and training. Your\ncommander should provide guidance and identify appropriate\nsecurity review procedures when photography is necessary.\ne)      Communication Strategy. Ensure all information, pictures, \nvideos, etc. undergo an OPSEC review based off your individual unit\u2019s\nCIIL before releasing to the public. COMMSTRAT personnel can assist\nwith visual information policy and procedures. \nf)      Social Media. Social media is ever present on your devices;\nmany applications persistently collect identifiable information \nabout you, your location, and your associations that can be \nexploited by adversaries. If you do use social media, utilize U.S.\nbased social media applications, ensure your settings are private, \nand do not post anything that an adversary may use to ascertain\ncritical information about Marine Corps operations. Avoid \napplications made by companies that are based in adversary\ncountries/locations or those that have a demonstrated history\nof poor cyber security.\ng)      Family Awareness. Talk to your family members about OPSEC.\nThey might not even consider the dangers of sharing operational or\nsensitive information with friends, family, or on social media \nposts. You may need to have face-to-face conversations about\ntiming and general location of where you are deploying. However, \ninform your loved ones of what they can and cannot say to others.\nSpeak to your children about how important it is that they keep\ninformation about you private.  \n6. In every action, whether at home station or in the field,\nprioritize the protection of our operations from passive and active\ncollection by foreign intelligence entities.  The safety of our \nfellow Marines and the success of our mission depend on the \nsecurity we maintain in all that we do.  Stay vigilant, stay \nsecure, and continue to uphold the highest standards of \noperations security.\n7. Points of contact:\n7.a. Col John Maher, PP&O, PLX, Special Activities Branch\nHead: 703-692-4866, email: john.maher@usmc.mil\n7.b.

Delay of Promotion\n4.a.  Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (g), if the\nrespective commanding officer determines that an officer is not\nmentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for\npromotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the\nphysical examination requirement for reserve officers per section\n10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the\nofficer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the\nappointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the\nnotice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers\nmust also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the\nappointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps\nTotal Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of\nadministrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain\nguidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.\n4.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this\npromotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or\npotentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)\nremoved the names of those officers with records identified during\nthe adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially\nadverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN.  Those\nofficers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC\n(JPL).\n5.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary\nretirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to\nacceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion\ncarries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with\naugmentation into the regular component.\n6.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve\nofficer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have\naccepted such promotion on the effective date contained in\nparagraphs 2 and 3 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and\nallowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion,\nan officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC\n(MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their\npromotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the\nnext higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which\nsignals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their\nright to decline.\n7.  For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-9705 or\nDSN 278-9705.  Email inquiries may be submitted via the Officer\nPromotions homepage at www.Marines.mil.  Email address is\nofficerpromotions@usmc.mil.\n8.  Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower\nManagement Division.//"

LM designated PMOSs.\n6.a.  LM PMOSs are listed under paragraphs 5.a, 5.b, and 5.c with\nthe LM designation.  These PMOSs are authorized bonus payments to\nMarines who execute a LM in conjunction with a reenlistment in their\nrespective Zones.  Marines who request LM into a PMOS may submit for\nreenlistment immediately and do not have to wait until their current\nPMOSs boatspaces are closed out prior to requesting a LM boatspace.\n6.b.  Bonus payment for LM PMOSs will not be made at the time of\nreenlistment but upon successful completion of PMOS training and\nsubsequent award of the PMOS.  Bonus payment will be based upon the\nFY SRB authorized at the time of reenlistment.  Marines who are in\ntraining beyond 30 September 2026 will be authorized payment of the\nPMOS bonus once the Marine Corps Total Force System shows they have\nbeen awarded the new PMOS.\n6.c.  Marines who fail to complete required LM PMOS training will be\nre-designated or administratively separated according to the needs\nof the Marine Corps and will receive no bonus, even if the PMOS the\nMarine is reclassified into is eligible to receive one.\n7. Administrative Elements.\n7.a.  Boatspace quotas will only be exceeded upon approval by\nCommandant of the Marine Corps (CMC), Manpower Plans, Policy, and\nBudget (MPP). Reenlistments approved in excess of boatspace quotas\nper PMOS may rate a bonus if available funding exists and is\nauthorized by CMC (MPP).  Marines are encouraged to reenlist early\nin the FY26 retention campaign to secure their boatspace and bonus.\n7.b. PMOS bonus authority is granted for service in the PMOS. As of\nthe date time group (DTG) of the MARADMIN announcing approved\nselections to first sergeant/master sergeant, Marines selected to\nfirst sergeant will not be eligible to receive a PMOS bonus. Marines\neligible for promotion to first sergeant/master sergeant who execute\nreenlistment prior to the release of the selection MARADMIN will\nreceive a PMOS bonus if eligible.  Example: A Zone C 0372 gunnery\nsergeant who is eligible for promotion and reenlists prior to the\nDTG of the release of the selection MARADMIN will receive a PMOS\nbonus of $55,000. Additionally, a Zone C 0372 gunnery sergeant who\nis selected to master sergeant and reenlists after the DTG of the\nrelease of the selection MARADMIN will receive a PMOS bonus of\n$55,000.  However, a Zone C 0372 gunnery sergeant who is selected to\nfirst sergeant and reenlists after the DTG of the release of the\nselection MARADMIN is no longer eligible to receive a PMOS bonus.\n7.c.  Flat Rate PMOS Bonus.  The pre-tax flat rate PMOS bonus\namounts authorized are based on the Marine's reenlistment Zone,\nthe Marine's grade on the date of reenlistment, the PMOS for which\nthe Marine is reenlisting, and the kicker or initiative the Marine\nselects (if any).\n7.d.  Obligated Service and Computation of PMOS Bonus.  The PMOS\nbonus dollar amount is impacted by the number of months of\nadditional obligated service for which the Marine reenlists.\nObligated service is defined as the time between the Marine\u2019s\nECC at the time of reenlistment and the ECC of the Marine's new\ncontract immediately after reenlistment.  Marines who are not\neligible for the 72 or 96-month reenlistment incentive must reenlist\nfor a minimum of 48 months of additional obligated service to\nget the full PMOS bonus.  On a case-by-case basis, CMC (MMEA-1)\nmay authorize reenlistment periods of less than 48 months. These\nMarines will be eligible for a PMOS bonus at a prorated amount if\ntheir reenlistment period includes at least 36 months\nof additional obligated service.  Marines who reenlist for less\nthan 36 months of additional obligated service, excluding any\ninitiatives addressed in this MARADMIN, are not eligible for any\nPMOS bonus.  Marines will rate the PMOS bonus applicable to\ntheir Zone, their grade, and their MOS as authorized in this\nMARADMIN.  The kickers listed in paragraph 4 of this MARADMIN are\nonly available to 48-month additional obligated service contracts.\nNo prorated amounts on kickers or initiatives will be authorized.\n(1) Example: A Marine whose ECC is 15 March 2026 and is reenlisting\nwith an effective date of 16 March 2026 will be required to reenlist\nfor 48 months to rate the full 48-month PMOS bonus payment.\n(2) Example: A Marine whose ECC is 15 March 2026 and is reenlisting\nwith an effective date of 14 March 2026 will be required to reenlist\nfor 49 to rate the full 48-month PMOS bonus payment.  (3) Example:\nMarines reenlisting for other than 48 months of obligated service\nwill rate the number of months of obligated service/48 months x the\nPMOS bonus authorized rounded to the nearest dollar.  An 0231\ncorporal in Zone A decides to reenlist for 39 months of obligated\nservice, their ECC is 15 December 2025 prior to reenlistment, and\nafter reenlistment their ECC is 15 March 2029.  The PMOS bonus\nauthorized will be as follows: 39 months/48 months x $14,000 =\n$11,375.  (4) Example: A sergeant in Zone A reenlists into the 2631\nPMOS and reenlists for 60 months of obligated service at time of\nreenlistment.  The PMOS bonus authorized will be limited to the full\n48-month PMOS bonus amount of $31,750.  Final determination of all\nbonus recoupment amounts will be made by a disbursing office or the\nDefense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS).\n7.e.  SRB Payment Caps.  Per reference (a), no Marine will\nexceed $360,000 in career SRB payments.  Example: A Zone A sergeant\nwho successfully LMs into 0211 on a 72-month contract will receive\n$105,000.  That Marine will only rate a total of $255,000 in future\nbonuses regardless of the amounts published in future SRB MARADMINs.\n7.f.  Years of Service Calculation.  To determine a Marine's years\nof active military service, the Armed Forces Active-Duty Base Date\nwill be used for all Marines.\n7.g.  Kicker Limitations. Marines may be eligible for multiple\nkickers as part of this Program, however Marines will be limited\nto receiving only one kicker upon reenlistment. (1) Example: A\nZone A 6176 corporal that is qualified to receive the Aircraft\nMaintenance Kicker and eligible for the Aircraft Readiness Kicker.\nThis Marine cannot receive both kickers and will have to choose\nwhich kicker to accept, adhering to its corresponding Statement of\nUnderstanding.\n8.  Recoupment Policy.\n8.a.  Marines who receive an SRB payment will be required to\nserve in a billet requiring the PMOS or skill for which they\nreceived the bonus payment, unless they serve in an authorized\nout-of-skill assignment, or a waiver is granted by the Secretary of\nthe Navy.  Failure to complete this requirement may result in\nrecoupment of the unearned portion of the Marine's reenlistment\nbonus as stated in reference (a).\n8.b.  Marines with an approaching ECC who are awaiting the\nresults of a board leading to an officer program or Marines who\nintend to submit for an officer program should request\nan extension of their current contract vice reenlistment.\nMarines who reenlist or extend solely to gain sufficient\nobligated service to participate in a program leading to a\ncommissioned or warrant officer status are not entitled to an\nSRB.\n8.c.  Marines who reenlist in their PMOS or skill then subsequently\napply to and are accepted into a program that will change their\nPMOS or skill or lead to a commission, are not subject to any\nrecoupment of SRB.  The term \"apply\u201d is defined as the date on a\nMarine's cover letter requesting consideration for one of these type\nprograms.  (1) Example: An 0629 staff sergeant in Zone C who\nreenlisted for 48 months of obligated service during FY24 and\nreceived a $4,500 PMOS bonus payment is entitled to keep their\nentire PMOS bonus payment if they apply for and are selected to\nbecome a career recruiter during FY26. (2) Example: An 0369 staff\nsergeant in Zone B who reenlisted for 48 months of obligated service\nduring FY24 and received a $23,500 PMOS bonus payment is entitled\nto keep their entire PMOS bonus payment if they apply for and are \nselected to the MECEP during FY26.\n8.d.  Marines who apply for a program which will change their PMOS\nor lead to a commission, then subsequently reenlist within their\nPMOS will not normally be considered eligible for an SRB and are\nsubject to recoupment of the unearned portion of any SRB payment\nreceived.  The term \"apply\" is defined as the date on a Marine's\ncover letter requesting consideration for one of these type\nprograms. (1) Example: An 0861 staff sergeant in Zone B applies to\nbecome a career recruiter on 1 January 2026, reenlists for 48 months\nof obligated service on 1 March 2026 receives a $17,000 PMOS bonus\npayment, and is accepted/assigned as a career recruiter on 1 June\n2026 would have the unexpired portion of obligated service recouped.\nRecoupment details: 45 months unexpired obligated service/48 months\noriginal obligated service x $17,000 PMOS bonus payment received:\n$15,937 total recoupment.  Final determination of all SRB recoupment\namounts will be made by a disbursing office or DFAS.\n9.  Coordinating Instructions.\n9.a.  The FY26 SRB Program Statement of Understanding is available\nfor download from the Total Force Retention System and the Enlisted\nRetention Manpower page. References (a) through (d) contain\namplifying instruction for the execution of enlisted bonus payments.\n9.b.  To align with the Return on Investment talent management\ninitiative, the Marine Corps is updating the SRB payment methodology\nto enhance career stability and retention efforts.\n9.c.  Marines will have the opportunity to reenlist ahead of their\nretention cohort year, securing reenlistment incentives, duty\nstation assignments, and career progression opportunities without\ndelay. SRB payments will be made in the fiscal year of their ECC\nrather than at the time of reenlistment.\n9.d.  This early enlistment opportunity enables the Marine Corps to\nexecute retention campaigns efficiently while providing Marines\nwith a stable and predictable reenlistment process. The payment\nmethodology ensures Marines continue to receive financial incentives\ntied to their reenlistment.\n9.e.  Marines who reenlist under this framework will lock in their\nbonus eligibility, career assignments, and obligated service while\nreceiving SRB payment in the appropriate fiscal year. In the\nunlikely event that a Marine does not receive their bonus payment\nwithin their designated retention fiscal year, they will have the\noption to submit for separation within 90 days of concluding FY.\n10.  If SRB funds are obligated faster than currently planned or a\nchange in retention requirements is necessary, Headquarters, United\nStates Marine Corps will suspend or terminate the FY26 SRB Program\nas needed prior to 30 September 2026.\n11.  This MARADMIN is not applicable to the Marine Corps Reserve.\n12.  Release authorized by Lieutenant General Michael J.\nBorgschulte, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//"

Under the provisions of section 578 of ref (a) and ref (c), the\nSecretary of the Navy, acting for the President of the United\nStates, hereby authorizes the promotion of the following named\nregular officer(s) as indicated, to the permanent grade of Chief\nWarrant Officer Four (CWO4) and Chief Warrant Officer Three (CWO3).\nRank, pay, and allowances are effective from 1 May 2025.\nName                            Grade        MCC\nTimothy A. Taylor               CWO4         017\nAndrew J. Wenzel                CWO3         1CF\n6.  Delay of Promotion\n6.a.  Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (h), if the\nrespective commanding officer determines that an officer is not\nmentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for\npromotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the\nphysical examination requirement for reserve officers per section\n10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the\nofficer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the\nappointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the\nnotice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers\nmust also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the\nappointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps\nTotal Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of\nadministrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain \nguidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.\n6.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this\npromotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or\npotentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)\nremoved the names of those officers with records identified during\nthe adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially\nadverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those\nofficers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC\n(JPL).\n7.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary\nretirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to\nacceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion\ncarries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with\naugmentation into the regular component.\n8.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve\nofficer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have\naccepted such promotion on the effective date contained in\nparagraphs 2 through 5 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and\nallowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion,\nan officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC\n(MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their\npromotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the\nnext higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which\nsignals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their\nright to decline.\n9.  The following FY25 promotions are projected for June 2025 and\nare subject to change.  Promotions from the remaining FY25 boards\nwill be promulgated based on vacancy determination and senate\nconfirmation.\n            Senior Officer        Sel    Junior Officer        Sel\nCol (R)     S.

If an attorney is a\nmember of two bar associations, and one association waives or reduces \ndues for active-duty service, the attorney may still claim \nreimbursement for dues paid to both associations, up to the $500 \nlimit. Membership in a jurisdiction's bar association may be \nreimbursed only if the jurisdiction requires such membership in order\nto practice law in their jurisdiction.\n5.b.

For Reserve and Selected Marine Corps Reserve judge advocates, \nreimbursement is not authorized for a qualifying expense that has \nbeen or will be paid, directly or through reimbursement, by the judge \nadvocate\u2019s civilian employer.\n5.e.  Reimbursement is only authorized for qualifying expenses \nincurred after appointment as a judge advocate.\n5.f.  For fiscal year 2025, reimbursement will be limited to up to \n$500 per attorney and is subject to the availability of funds.\n6.  Process.  \n6.a.

ATTEMA/GS-12/MFPC/TEL: 703-784-9512/\nEMAIL: JASON.G.ATTEMA@USMC.MIL//\nGENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  This MARADMIN announces the mandatory Marine\nCorps-wide transition to the use of Department of Defense casualty\nreporting software, Defense Casualty Information Processing\nSystem-Personnel Casualty Report (DCIPS-PCR) spreadsheet method, for\nreceiving and disseminating casualty reports.  Additionally, this\nMARADMIN cancels reference (a) and further clarifies reporting\nrequirements previously published in chapter 3 of reference (b).\n2.  The DCIPS-PCR spreadsheet method replaces DCIPS-8.0 (also known\nas DCIPS-Forward) as the sole authorized method for submitting\nPersonnel Casualty Reports (PCR) throughout the Marine Corps,\neffective immediately.  This new casualty reporting process is\nmandated due to the end-of-service life of the DCIPS-8.0 software.\nThe transition to the DCIPS-PCR spreadsheet simplifies the casualty\nreporting process, provides considerable flexibility for reporting\nin unique and dynamic situations, and reduces the administrative\nburden for reporting units.\n3.  The casualty reporting procedures for DCIPS 8.0 are no longer in\neffect.  Instructions, training materials, and casualty report\ntemplates for submitting reports are available on the casualty\nmanpower website at https: (slash)(slash)www.manpower.marines.mil\n(slash)Marine-and-Family-Programs(slash)Military-Personnel-\nServices(slash), and through the Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC)\nCasualty Section (MFPC) DCIPS-PCR Transition Microsoft Teams\nchannel.\n4.  The DCIPS-PCR spreadsheet establishes two methods for reporting\ncasualties to MFPC:  Method One for singular casualties and Method\nTwo for multiple casualties.  When reporting an individual casualty,\nuse the Method One template.  The individual spreadsheet used for\ninitial reports must be used to create Status Change Reports \n(STACH), Progress Reports (PROG), or Supplemental Reports (SUPP).\nSTACH, PROG, or SUPP reports will be documented by adding a new\ncolumn to the existing spreadsheet and updating report data.  All\nreports will be submitted to HQMC via email to the casualty OMB \ncasualty.section@usmc.mil.  For reporting multiple casualty\nincidents, use the Method Two template.  This method is\nspecifically designed for the initial reporting of mass casualty\nevents involving five or more casualties.  After units provide the\ninitial report using Method Two, an individual report for each\ncasualty must be submitted to HQMC using Method One.  These\nprocedures enable the immediate reporting of mass casualty events\nwithout unnecessary administrative delays.  HQMC will not accept any\nreports submitted directly through the DCIPS-PCR web portal.  PCRs\nwill only be processed if they are submitted according to the\nguidance provided on the Casualty Manpower website or Microsoft\nTeams Channel.\n5.  MFPC will upload the processed PCR into DCIPS-PCR and provide a\nfinalized report to the reporting unit.  This report will serve as\nthe unit's historical record for casualty affairs program inspection\npurposes.\n6.  The updated reporting procedures do not relieve units, once\ninformed of a reportable garrison casualty, from the obligation to\nprovide MFPC with a voice report as soon as made aware of the\nsituation per reference (b).  The timeframe for submitting the\nrequired voice report has been shortened from one hour to 30\nminutes.  Additionally, the relevant casualty template must be\nsubmitted for review to casualty.section@usmc.mil within one hour.\nDelays in reporting due to reviews and approvals from individuals\noutside of the immediate command are not valid justifications for\nfailing to meet timelines.  MFPC will make the final determination\nof the content requirements within a PCR.\n7.  Training sessions will be scheduled, and dates will be announced\nvia the HQMC, MFPC DCIPS-PCR Transition Teams channel (dates TBA\nwithin the channel).  The Teams link can be found on the Casualty\nManpower site under the provided link.\n8.  Questions may be sent via email to casualty.section@usmc.mil or\nvia phone at (703)784-9512, option 1.\n9.  This MARADMIN applies to the reporting of all Marine Corps\ncasualties.\n10.  Release authorized by Lieutenant General Michael J. \nBorgschulte, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//"

The Marine Corps continues to update procedures \nand guidance to ensure clarity and alignment with promotion \npolicies.  Over time, various Marine Administrative Messages \n(MARADMINs) have introduced incremental changes, some of which are \nnow obsolete due to policy updates, including release of Marine \nCorps Order 1616.1, Junior Enlisted Performance Evaluation System \n(JEPES), in 2020.  To eliminate outdated guidance and provide \nMarines with clear and relevant policies, five MARADMINs require \ncancellation.  These MARADMINs have either been incorporated into \nexisting orders or superseded by more recent changes, such as \nupdates to time-in-grade (TIG) and time-in-service (TIS) \nrequirements, JEPES score calculations, and board submission \nprocesses. Canceling these obsolete MARADMINs will prevent confusion\nand reinforce a streamlined, up-to-date promotion policy framework.  \nThe following five MARADMINs are canceled:\n1.a.  MARADMIN 285/05.  Guidance has been incorporated into\nreference (a).\n1.b.  MARADMIN 055/16.  Superseding messages made the MARADMIN \nobsolete.  The following minimum TIG and TIS requirements apply for\npromotion and will be incorporated into reference (a).\n                       Regular Promotion     Meritorious Promotion\nGrade Promoted To       TIG     TIS               TIG     TIS\nSgtMaj/MGySgt            3 YRS  10 YRS            N/A      N/A\n1stSgt/MSgt              4 YRS   8 YRS            N/A      N/A\nGySgt                    3 YRS   6 YRS            N/A      6 YRS\nSSgt                     3 YRS   5 YRS            N/A      4 YRS\nSgt                     12 MOS   4 YRS (Note 1)   N/A     18 MOS\nCpl                     12 MOS  12 MOS            N/A      6 MOS\nLCpl                     8 MOS   9 MOS            N/A      N/A\nPFC                      6 MOS   6 MOS            N/A      N/A \nNote 1: Cpls who meet the conditions outlined in reference (b) are \nauthorized promotion to Sgt with a TIS of three years.  \n1.c.  MARADMIN 200/16.  There is no requirement to conduct promotion\npanels prior to recommending a Marine for promotion.\n1.c.1.  It is still incumbent upon commanders to personally invest \nthemselves in the process of noncommissioned officer (NCO) \npromotions to ensure Marines not only meet the Commandant's intent, \nbut to ensure the integrity of our valued NCO Corps for today and \ninto the future.\n1.c.2.  To ensure Marines are not left in a prolonged \nNOT RECOMMENDED (non-rec) status, Commanders will establish internal \ncontrol measures to review Marines.  At a minimum, commanders will \nreview non-rec status during the semiannual junior enlisted \nperformance evaluation occasion.  Commanders may establish stricter\nprocedures as promotions scores occur monthly.  These internal \ncontrol measures are inspectable by the Marine Corps Administrative \nAnalysis Team and justification for Marines left in a non-rec status\nfor longer than three months is required.\n1.d.

The Marine Corps provides the \nopportunity to lead these remarkable Marines to officers who have \ndemonstrated great leadership performance.  Selection as an RSCO is \na unique distinction with tremendous opportunity to shape the \nfuture of the Marine Corps and to develop both professionally and \npersonally.  Successful tours indicate outstanding leadership\nability, which is acknowledged via higher selection percentages \nthan peers for future command opportunities.  In the past five\nyears 64 percent of successful RSCOs were selected as primaries for \nLieutenant Colonel command versus a 23 percent selection rate \noverall.\n2.  Process.

The AA form must be favorably endorsed by the first O-5 \ncommanding officer in the Marine's chain of command and must \nreceive concurrence from the PMOS monitor via email.

RIEGER/CIV/IID, DC I/TEL: 703-692-0157/EMAIL: \nMARK.RIEGER@USMC.MIL//  \nGENTEXT/REMARKS/ 1.  Purpose: This MARADMIN provides guidance for \nunserviceable General Service Administration (GSA) containers and \nvault doors. \n2.  Background: Command Security Managers and Special Security \nOfficers maintain containers and  \nvault doors for the protection of classified information. The \nInformation Security Oversight  \nOffice (ISOO) has determined that GSA containers and vault doors \nmanufactured prior to 1989 no longer meet the standards for \nprotection of classified material and cannot be repaired/updated \nfor continued use. All pre-1989 GSA containers must be removed from \nservice NLT 1 October 2028, and vault doors NLT 1 October 2035. \n3.  Execution: \n3.a.  Authorities. \n3.a.1. Reference (b) and (c) only apply to GSA containers and vault \ndoors used for the protection of classified information. Containers \nand vault doors used for protection of AA&E are not subject to this \nrequirement.\n3.a.2.  Per references (b) and (c), class five and six containers \nand class five vault doors manufactured \nprior to 1989 no longer meet the standards for protection of \nclassified material and must be removed from service. These \ncontainers and vault doors may be visually identified by black \nlettering on the silver GSA approval label and are commonly referred \nto as \"black label\" containers or doors. The phase out of \"black \nlabel\" containers must be complete NLT 1 October 2028. \n3.a.3.  Reference (c) extends the phase out for \u201cblack label\u201d vault \ndoors to 1 October 2035.  \n3.b.  NLT 30 April 2025, Command Security Managers and Special \nSecurity Officers will inventory all GSA containers and vault doors \nunder their control, recommend consolidation of classified \ninformation where practical, formulate a plan for purchase of new \nGSA containers where necessary, and begin disposal of all black \nlabel containers ensuring that all black label containers are \nremoved from service NLT than 1 October 2028. \n3.b.1.  NLT 31 May, 2025, commands will identify GSA approved \nblack label vault doors to the servicing facilities office and \ncoordinate necessary actions to remove and replace the vault \ndoor NLT 1 October 2035. \n3.c.  During the phase out period, black label containers may not \nbe repaired. As directed in reference (d), neutralization of a \nlocked-out container and replacement of the lock is considered a \nrepair and is no longer authorized. Locked out black label \ncontainers will be neutralized and removed from service per \nparagraph 3.d.8. below. Reference (d) does provide for certain \nlimited and minor field adjustments which do not meet the definition \nof a repair. GSA certified inspectors and technicians can assist in \ndetermining if these adjustments are authorized for the container \nin question. \n3.d.  Procedure for containers. \n3.d.1.  Command Security Managers and Special Security Officers will \ncoordinate consolidation of classified material into GSA containers \nmanufactured after 1989. These containers can be visually identified \nby red lettering on the GSA approval label. Where purchase of new \ncontainers is required, follow the procedures in para 3.d.8 of this \nMARADMIN. Due to the high cost and long lead time for procurement of \nnew containers, purchases should be included in the command's \nbudgetary cycle. \n3.d.2.  Where a container has been recertified, that container will \nalways be identified by black lettering on the GSA approval label; \nhowever, the label will specifically state \"recertified container\". \nThe servicing GSA inspector will indicate the original label color \non the recertification label and this original color will be used \nwhen complying with reference (b).  \n3.d.3. Any uncertainty regarding the container manufacture date may \nbe confirmed from information found on the manufacturer's label \nwhich can be located on one side or the other of the control drawer \nwhen open, or on the back of the door for GSA approved vault doors. \nThe manufacturer's label will include the container's class and date \nof manufacture along with other data. \n3.d.4.  Where there are continued concerns over a container or vault \ndoor, commands may obtain installation or local locksmith services \nprovided the responding locksmith has the proper GSA credentials. \n3.d.5.  Commands are reminded that GSA containers with blue \nlettering on the GSA approval label may only to be used for the \nstorage of classified ADP equipment such as classified servers and \nmay not be used for the storage of hard copy classified material. \n3.d.6. Where black label containers containing the current model \nhigh security lock the commands may elect to repurpose the lock \nfor use on future repairs of post 1989 containers. The approved high \nsecurity locks are the Kaba X10 and the Sergeant and Greenleaf S&G \n2740. Approved  locks may be removed by GSA certified locksmiths and \nretained for reuse. Kaba X07, X08, and X09 locks may not be \nrepurposed and will be disposed of with the container or vault door. \nFor assistance with lock identification review the security hardware \nsection of the DOD Lock Program noted in paragraph 3.d.8 below. \n3.d.7.  To dispose of unserviceable containers the Command Security \nManager and/or Special Security Officer will inspect the container \nto ensure no classified material remains inside, reset the lock \ncombination to the \"out of service\" combination of 50-25-50, and \nremove the GSA approval label. Dispose of the container per \nreference (e) using a condition code of \"S\" for scrap. Disposal of \nvault doors will be included in the planning for door replacement. \n3.d.8.  IAW reference (f), new GSA containers and vault doors may \nonly be purchased through GSA global supply. NSNs and instructions \nfor procurement of new GSA containers and vault doors may be found \non the DOD Lock Program website at https:(Slash)(Slash)exwc.navfac.\nnavy.mil/DoD-Lock-Program/Security\u00adHardware/\nGSA-Approved -Security-Containers. \nWhen ordering new containers and vault doors ensure use of the \ncorrect NSN for the desired lock type. Style, one locks are the \nKaba X10, style two locks are the S&G 2740. \n3.d.9.  Assistance in locating a GSA certified locksmith, inspector, \nor technician may be found from any of the following sources: The \nDOD Lock Program website; Kaba Mas (X10): www.kabamas.com; \nSergeant and Greenleaf (S&G 2740): www.sargentandgreenleaf.com/\nproduct/2740b/; GSA approved training centers: Lockmasters Security \nInstitute: 859-887-9633, or MBA USA: 859-887-0496 \n4.  Reporting requirements. \n4.a.  All actions and documentation required by this MARADMIN will \nbe held locally. Compliance with this MARADMIN will be added to the \nfunctional area checklist 5510.3 and included in all future \ninspections though October 2028 for containers, October 2035 for \nvault doors. \n5.  Direct all questions to this MARADMIN\u2019s point of contact. \n6.  Release authorized by Lieutenant General M. G. Carter, \nDeputy Commandant for Information, U.S. Marine Corps.//"

The board will select RC officers\nfor designated commands/Reserve Senior Leader (RSL) billets projected\nto be vacated between 1 October 2025 and 30 September 2026.  RSL\nbillets are not designated command billets, but they entail\nsignificant responsibility.  Therefore, applicants applying for RSL\nbillets are governed by the same competitive criteria.\n2.

Board Process.  The boards will select a number of officers equal\nto the number of commands available.  Additionally, the boards will\nselect a sufficient number of officers as alternates to meet command\nrequirements if primaries decline or otherwise cannot take command. \nThe boards will develop proposed command slates for the primary\nselectees and will forward those slates, along with the alternates\nlist, to the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) for approval.  Once\nthe proposed slate and list are approved, board results listing the\nprimary selectees will be announced via Marine Administrative\n(MARADMIN) message.  The alternates list will remain valid until the\nconvening of the next command screening board.  Both primary and\nalternate lists will be posted on the RAM-3 website at\nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.manpower.marines.mil/Manpower-\nManagement/Reserve-Affairs-Division/Reserve-Affairs-Management-RAM\nunder the \"Reserve Programs and Boards (RAM-3)\" tab and \"Reserve\nOfficer Command Screening Program\" dropdown menu.\n4.

Under the provisions of section 578 of ref (a) and ref (c), the\nSecretary of the Navy, acting for the President of the United\nStates, hereby authorizes the promotion of the following named\nregular officer(s) as indicated, to the permanent grade of Chief\nWarrant Officer Five (CWO5) through Chief Warrant Officer Three\n(CWO3).  Rank, pay, and allowances are effective from 1 April 2025.\nName                            Grade        MCC\nRaymond M. GarciaCortijo        CWO5         JF1\nStephen E.

Per refs (b) and (h), if the\nrespective commanding officer determines that an officer is not\nmentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for\npromotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the\nphysical examination requirement for reserve officers per section\n10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the\nofficer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the\nappointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the\nnotice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers\nmust also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the\nappointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps\nTotal Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of\nadministrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain \nguidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.\n6.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this\npromotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or\npotentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)\nremoved the names of those officers with records identified during\nthe adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially\nadverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those\nofficers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC\n(JPL).\n7.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary\nretirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to\nacceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion\ncarries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with\naugmentation into the regular component.\n8.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve\nofficer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have\naccepted such promotion on the effective date contained in\nparagraphs 2 through 5 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and\nallowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion,\nan officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC\n(MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their\npromotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the\nnext higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which\nsignals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their\nright to decline.\n9.  The following FY24 promotions are projected for May 2025 and\nare subject to change.

Purpose.  To update Service guidance,\nreimbursement procedures, eligibility criteria, and reporting\nrequirements for IDT Travel Reimbursement in accordance with\nreference (a) due to an increase in the limit for reimbursement from\n500 to 750 dollars for each round trip. The increased reimbursement\nlimit is authorized for round trips with an end date that occurs on\nor after 27 December 2024.  Current eligibility for IDT Travel\nReimbursement does not guarantee eligibility under future policy\nupdates to the IDT Travel Reimbursement Program.\n2.  Background.  This program is designed to reimburse travel and\ntransportation expenses for select Marines who perform IDT that\nrequires them to commute outside the local commuting distance.\n3.  Eligibility\n    a.  Marines serving in critical staffing shortfalls within the\nSelected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR); SMCR command screened billets;\nDeputy Commandant, Manpower and Reserve Affairs (DC M&RA) Senior\nLeader and General Officer Assignments; and Individual Mobilization\nAugmentee (IMA) Reserve Senior Leader Board (RSLB) billets.  Members\nof the IMA Program not in General Officer or RSLB screened billets\nare not eligible for IDT travel reimbursement.\n    b.  Distance.  Marines must be assigned to a unit located 150\nmiles or more from their official primary residence address (PRA) in\nMarine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) as calculated by the Defense\nTable of Official Distances (DTOD) using Permanent Change of\nStation/Temporary Duty route type.  \n    c.  BIC match.  Marines must be assigned to a BIC that is\nequivalent to their Primary Military Occupational Specialty (PMOS),\nAdditional MOS (AMOS), have an exception request approved by Reserve\nAffairs (RA), or be an acceptable BIC mismatch per the most recent\nreference (b).  Billet grade of one-up/down is authorized. \nCommand-screened commanders may be allowed up to three additional\nmonths for turnover if placed in Excess BIC 009.  Excess BICs or\nthose categorized as a discrepancy, per reference (b), are not\neligible without an exception request. \n    d.  There are no rank or MOS limitations. \n    e.  Corporals, sergeants, and staff sergeants who submit a PMOS\n0211 lateral move package to fill an open 0211 BIC are eligible for\nreimbursement to conduct the board interview process. Once travel is\nconducted, the unit will contact SMB_IDT_TRAVEL@USMC.MIL for the\nwaiver and Line of Accounting.\n    f.  Marines assigned to 4th Reconnaissance Company located in\nKaneohe Bay, Hawaii, who commute less than 150 miles to their \nReserve Training Center (RTC) but require off-island travel are \nauthorized reimbursement.  \n4.  Waivers.  Waiver requests for eligibility requirements will be\nconsidered on a case-by-case basis by RA.  Marines must submit\nrequests via NAVMC 10274 endorsed by the chain of command, to\ninclude the MSC Headquarters, and the Commander, Marine Forces\nReserve (COMMARFORRES) AC/S G-1.\n5.  Reimbursement.  Total reimbursement for a round trip with an end\ndate that occurs prior to 27 December 2024 will be limited to 500\ndollars for each round trip.  Total reimbursement for a round trip\nwith an end date that occurs on or after 27 December 2024 will be\nlimited to 750 dollars per round trip per reference (a).  \n    a.  Allowances.  Actual costs and fees incurred as a result of\ntravel may be paid as reimbursable expenses not to exceed 500 or\n750 dollars per round trip between the member's PRA as entered in\nMCTFS and the assigned RTC.  Per reference (a), commercial\ntransportation costs to and from the RTC including transportation\nfrom the PRA to the terminal and to and from the terminal and the\nRTC (taxi or other paid transportation) are reimbursable.  If a\nprivately owned vehicle is used, mileage reimbursement at the \u201cother\nmileage rate\u201d and any parking fees or tolls incurred are\nreimbursable.  If a rental car is authorized or approved, only costs\nfor travel days to and from the IDT location may be paid.  This\nincludes use of rental vehicle between home and the terminal and\nbetween the terminal and the training location.  The Disbursing\nOffice/Finance Office will calculate the reimbursable amount if a\nrental vehicle was retained for the duration of the IDT period.\nNo authority exists to reimburse transportation expense incurred\nwhile executing IDT at the IDT location.  All JTR rental vehicle\nrules apply.  Only \u201cactual\u201d costs for meals, trips, and taxes may be\nreimbursed up to the maximum meal rate and incidental expenses\n(M&IE) rate for the duty location may be reimbursed.  Travelers are\nadvised to retain and submit all receipts.  Receipts are required\nfor any individual expenditure of 75 dollars, or more being sought\nfor reimbursement per reference (a).\n    b.  Frequency.  Reimbursement is limited to eleven (11) round\ntrips per Marine, per Fiscal Year (FY).  Aviators (MOS 75XX) \nassigned Duties Involving Flying \u2013 Operational (DIFOP) to SMCR \nsquadrons are allowed reimbursement not to exceed twenty-two (22)\nround trips per FY to include additional paid drills (APD) necessary\nto meet minimum annual flight hour requirements.\n    c.  Reimbursement, if approved, is authorized to begin on the \nday approved by COMMARFORES.\n6.  Coordinating Instructions\n    a.  Marine Forces Reserve (MARFORRES) will compile the list of\nall potentially eligible Marines by applying the rule sets detailed\nin paragraph 3 of this message.

This is a HQMC PP&O (POP/POR/POF), \nHQMC I&L (LPM/LPO/LPS), TECOM (MAGTF-TC G-3, Policy and\nStandards Division), MCICOM (G-3/5), MARFOR Readiness and\nExercise Offices, and MEF Readiness and Exercise Offices \ncoordinated message.\n2.  Purpose.  This MARADMIN provides interim guidance for \nchemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense \n(CBRND) readiness reporting specific to training, \nequipping, assessment/certification, per REF A through T.\nThis MARADMIN cancels MARADMIN 135/23.\n3.  Background.  In accordance with the references, units\norganize, train, equip, and certify, through exercise \nscenarios, to ensure forces can perform required mission \nessential tasks (MET) in CBRN environments.  This provides \nproperly trained Fleet Marine Forces (FMF) to combatant \nand joint force commanders\u2019 countering weapons of mass \ndestruction (CWMD) objectives.  The metrics for CBRND \ntraining and equipment readiness have not kept pace with \nchanges in data systems and strategy requirements.  The \ninterim guidance in this MARADMIN will collect objective \nunit and individual readiness data to inform policy \nchanges.  Commanders will report CBRND readiness using \ncurrent interim guidance.\n4.  CBRND Training Factors.  CBRND training is divided \ninto five distinct factors listed in 4.A. through 4.E.  \nCommanders will calculate their units\u2019 CBRND T-levels \nbased on the factors and report the reason code from the\n table in 4.F. which best illustrates the limiting factor:\n4.A.  FACTOR ONE: CBRN Individual Training Standards \n(ITS).\n4.A.1.  Criteria.  The 17 ITS are listed in REF D.  ITS \nprovide the essential skills personnel must master to \nsurvive a CBRN incident and will be conducted through \nclassroom training, practical application, or field \ntraining, as appropriate.  Units are encouraged to conduct\n training separate from the Individual Protective \nEquipment Confidence Exercise (IPECE).  If a unit does not\n have organic CBRND personnel, commanders will coordinate \ntraining support through higher headquarters.  Completion \nof ITS is recorded in MCTIMS with code CB\u2013CBRND ITS.\n4.A.2.  Calculation:  Number of on-hand personnel who have \ncompleted ITS in the last 12 months divided by total \npersonnel on-hand equals percent of trained personnel.\n4.B.  FACTOR TWO: Individual Protective Equipment \nConfidence Exercise.\n4.B.1.  Criteria.  Completion of an IPECE within the \nprevious 12 months.  Completion does not need to have been \nwith the current unit.  If a unit does not have organic \nCBRND personnel, commanders will coordinate training \nsupport through higher headquarters.  Completion of IPECE \nis recorded in MCTIMS with code CA-CBRND IPECE.\n4.B.2.  Calculation: Number of deployable O/H strength who \nhave completed the IPECE in the last 12 months divided by \ntotal deployable O/H strength equals IPECE completion \npercentage.\n4.C.  FACTOR THREE:  CBRN Monitor Team (formerly CBRN \nReconnaissance & Surveillance team) Training.\n4.C.1.  Criteria.  The requirement in REF D Encl (1) \nParagraph 3.c.(2)(b) is cancelled.  CBRN monitor teams \nemploy chemical and radiological detection equipment to \ninform the commanders decision making.  Commanders will \ntrain two operators for each M-4 Joint Chemical Agent \nDetector (TAMCN: C2014) on the unit table of equipment.  \nCommanders will provide team members initial and \nsustainment team training for all detection equipment on \nthe unit\u2019s table of equipment (T/E) in accordance with \nREF D.  Commanders may determine if additional CBRN \nmonitor team members are required based on assigned \nmissions.  Assignment as team members and completion of\ninitial training is recorded in MCTIMS with code CC\u2013CBRND\n Monitoring & Surveillance (Initial).  Sustainment \ntraining is recorded in MCTIMS with code CD\u2013CBRND \nMonitoring & Surveillance (Quarterly).\n4.C.2.  Calculation: Number of monitor team members \ntrained and current (quarterly sustainment completed) \ndivided by monitor team members required equals percentage\n of trained monitor team members.\n4.C.3.  Directed Comments: Number of team members \ntrained/number of team members required/percentage.  \n(Example: CBRN monitor teams: 1/8/13%)\n4.D.  FACTOR FOUR: Decontamination Teams:\n4.D.1.  Criteria.  The requirement in REF D Encl (1) \nParagraph 3.c.(4)(b) is cancelled.  Commanders will \ndetermine the number and composition of their \ndecontamination teams based on tables of equipment, unit \nof employment and mission analysis.  Initial and \nsustainment training will be completed in accordance with \nREF D.  Marine aircraft squadron commanders are required \nto train personnel in aircraft decontamination IOT \nmaintain readiness and regenerate sorties.  \nDecontamination team members may also serve on monitor \nteams.  Assignment as team members and completion of \ninitial training is recorded in MCTIMS with code CE\u2013CBRND \nDecontamination (Initial).  Sustainment training is \nrecorded in MCTIMS with code CF\u2013CBRND Decontamination \n(Quarterly).\n4.D.2.  Calculation: Number of team members trained and \ncurrent (quarterly sustainment completed) divided by team \nmembers required equals percent of team members trained.\n4.D.3.  Directed Comments: In the CBRN Overall comments \nbox, enter the number of decontamination team members \ntrained/number of team members required/percent.  (Example: \nCBRN decon teams: 24/36/67%)\n4.E.  FACTOR FIVE: METs evaluated in a simulated CBRN \nenvironment.\n4.E.1.  Reference B requires commanders to assess their \nunits\u2019 readiness to accomplish their missions in CBRN \nenvironments.  This requires units to integrate relevant \nsimulated CBRN environments into training and exercises.  \nThe baseline criteria for a simulated CBRN environment are \nplanning for CBRN threats and reacting to CBRN incidents \nduring a unit exercise.  Scenarios will exercise units\u2019 \nstaff planning processes and individual and collective \ntechniques, tactics, and procedures (TTP) to protect the \nunit and sustain operations.  Where practical, commanders \nwill request and incorporate CBRN response augments into \nscenarios.\n4.E.2.  All Other Unit Types\n4.E.2.A.  Commanders will review their METL and identify \nwhich METs their units are realistically expected to \nexecute in CBRN environments.\n4.E.2.B.  Commanders may request relief of MET training \nrequirements from the first general officer in the chain \nof command or his delegate.  If a waiver is granted, the \ncommander will only assess CBRND readiness for the \nremaining METs.  \n4.E.2.C.  Commanders must resubmit for relief of CBRND \ntraining requirements after 12-months.\n4.E.2.D.  Commanders relieved of all MET training \nrequirements will not factor MET assessment into the unit \nT-level.  Regardless of MET training requirements, \ncommanders will still complete CBRND individual and team \ntraining.\n4.E.2.E.  Calculation: Number of METs assessed internally \nin a simulated CBRN environment as Qualified Yes (Q) or \nevaluated externally as Yes (Y) during an exercise (MCCRE, \nSLTE, CERTEX, ETC.) in the past 12 months divided by \nnumber of METs required to be trained for CBRN \nenvironments equals percent of CBRN capable METs.  \nCommanders will not select T-1 unless all required METs \nare assessed as (Y) in a simulated CBRN environment.\n4.E.2.F.  Directed Comments.  In the CBRN Overall comments\nbox, commanders will list all METs, a Y/Q/N assessment of \nthe unit\u2019s ability to accomplish the MET in a CBRN \nenvironment, and the date the MET was observed in a \nsimulated CBRN environment.  METs approved for CBRND \ntraining relief will be listed as N/A with the date of \napproval. (Example: MCT 1.6.1/Q/20221110 or MCT \n4.5.7.3/N/A/20220501)\n4.F.  Determining CBRND T-level: After calculating the \npercentage for each of the required training factors, unit \ncommanders will select the requirement with the lowest \npercentage and use the corresponding CBRND T-Rating reason \ncode (read in 6 columns):\nFACTOR         T-1       T-2       T-3       T-4    T-CODE\nITS            >=85%     70-84%    55-69%    <55%   TNA\nIPECE          >=85%     70-84%    55-69%    <55%   TNF\nMONITOR TEAM   >=85%     70-84%    55-69%    <55%   TNC\nDECON TEAM     >=85%     70-84%    55-69%    <55%   TNC\nMET ASSESSMENT >=85%     70-84%    55-69%    <55%   TNB\n4.F.1.  When multiple factors contribute to a reduced \nT-rating, commanders shall select the reason code which \nbest communicates the shortfall.\n4.F.2.  Reason Codes.  This MARADMIN suspends the use of \ntraining codes TND, TNE, TNG, TNH, TNI, TNJ, TNL, TNN, \nTNO, and TNQ identified in REF I.  An update will be \nsubmitted to the appropriate defense office by PP&O for \napplicable Marine Corps readiness reason codes identified \nin REF H.\n4.G.  Information related to CBRND training in REF H is \nstill applicable.  PP&O has identified the discrepancy in \nterminology identified in REF H (CBRNE) and will update \nthis inaccuracy during the next review of this document.\n5.  CBRND Equipment: Unit commanders will track CBRND \nequipment IOT accomplish METs in a CBRN environment ISO \nMAGTF, CCMD, JFC assigned mission (including exercises).\n5.A.  General\n5.A.1.  Per REF (B), (J), and (K) CBRND equipment supports\nGeneral Purpose Force (GPF) units, identified personnel \naboard installations are issued prior to deployment, based \nupon increased intelligence indications and warnings of a \nCBRN threat.  CBRND equipment prepositioned, either afloat \nor at ashore sites, is for sustainment of the MAGTF.\n5.B.  CBRND Equipping.  Unit commanders retaining \nreportable CBRN equipment will calculate and report their \nunit\u2019s CBRND supply readiness (S-Level) as identified in \nREF B.\n5.C.  Unit Accountability/Responsibility.  Per REF (M), \nimmediately upon unit receipt, delivery, or acceptance of \nCBRND equipment, unit accountable officers, via their \nappointed supply officer/accountable property officer, \nwill establish Marine Corps accountable property records \nand maintain them using information technology. The \naccountability of Marine Corps property throughout its \nlifecycle will not be compromised by virtue of its status \n(i.e., excess, obsolete or unserviceable) or physical \nlocation (e.g., in-transit, in theater, or loaned to a \ncontractor).\n5.D.  Readiness Reporting.  Per REF (B) and (J) all \nserialized CBRND equipment (excluding individual issued \nfield protective mask) on-hand and identified on the \nunit\u2019s table of equipment (T/E) will be reported as \nprincipal end items (PEI), class II CBRND equipment, or \nconsumables.  PEI will be reported within the CBRND tab of\n DRRS by the unit S-4.  If PEI, class II CBRND equipment, \nor consumable shelf-life issues / shortages occur while \ndeployed or in possession of the equipment, units will \nutilize the best description reason code(s) identified \nwithin REF H to assist HQMC/MCSC/SE/JS/DOD in mitigating \nequipment shortfalls.  Note: Equipment in excess of the \nunit\u2019s T/E may be issued as determined by unit analysis \nand MEF approval.  As determined by higher headquarters, \ntasking in support of MAGTF, CCMD, or JFC operations / \nexercises, GPF units with attached CBRN Response \ncapabilities required to carry out assigned missions will \nreport CBRN response equipment as mission essential \nequipment (MEE) and identify this equipment as MEE on unit\nDRRS reports.\n5.E.  Information related to CBRND equipment in REF L is \nstill applicable.  PP&O has identified the discrepancy in \nterminology identified in REF L (CBRND-E & NBCDE) and will \nupdate this inaccuracy during the next review of this \ndocument.\n5.F.  Units assigned Marine Corps Task (MCT) 6.4 as a MET \nwill not report CBRN response training or equipment in the \nCBRND tab of DRRS.  These will be reported the same as all \nother METS in the core or assigned mission tabs.\n6.  CBRND Evaluation and Certification.  The evaluation \nand certification of a unit\u2019s ability to conduct METs \nunder simulated CBRN environment can be accomplished by \nidentified events in paragraphs 6.A. or 6.B. of this \nMARADMIN.\n6.A.  Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation (MCCRE)\n6.A.1.  In accordance with REF F, GPF baseline CBRND \ntraining identified in section 4.C. of this MARADMIN will \nbe assessed during a unit\u2019s MCCRE, which evaluates the \neffectiveness of the command\u2019s CBRND training and the \nunit\u2019s ability to execute related METs and respond to / \nrecover from a CBRN event/hazard.  This will ensure the \nunit\u2019s ability to support MAGTF operations/tasks and \nCCMD/JFC CWMD mission requirements.\n6.A.2.  Commanders will include CBRND personnel in the \npreparation and planning for upcoming MCCRE per REF F to \nensure deliberate planning and inclusion of a realistic, \nintelligence modeled CBRN scenario, IOT evaluate the \nunit\u2019s proficiency to accomplish METs while operating in a \nCBRN environment.\n6.A.3.  CBRND information related to REF E is still \napplicable.  PP&O has identified the discrepancy in \nterminology identified in REF F (NBC) and will update this \ninaccuracy during the next review of this document.  CBRND \nevaluations will be conducted by CBRND officers or SNCOs.\n6.B.  Service Level Training Event (SLTE).  Sections\n6.B.1. through 6.B.5. are in accordance with REF E.\n6.B.1.  Marine Air Ground Task Force-Training Command \n(MAGTF-TC).  MAGTF-TC facilitates and assesses CBRND \ntraining and readiness standards based on units Core METs.\n6.B.2.  MEFs will slate MSC CBRND personnel during the \nMARFORCOM Synchronization Conference to align with and \nsupport Integrated Training Exercise (ITX) and Adversary \nForce Exercise (AFX) infantry battalions beginning in \nFiscal Year 2025.\n6.B.3.  MAGTF-TC will develop CBRND training objectives \nwithin SLTE events IOT ensure Commanders across the MAGTF \nare able to employ CBRND capabilities ISO the MAGTF, \nCCMDs, and JFCs.\n6.B.4.  MAGTF-TC will develop CBRND/response training \nobjectives into Marine Corps Tactical and Operations Group \n(MCTOG) and Marine Corps Logistics Operations Group \n(MCLOG) curriculum IOT increase deliberate and rapid CBRND \nplanning proficiency across the force.\n6.B.5.  MAGTF-TC will identify required external support \nand source required augments through Force Sync \nConferences.\n7.  Nuclear Weapons Accident Incident Exercise (NUWAIX).  \nIn accordance with REF T, this exercise is required for \nDOD, State, and Federal Agencies to coordinate and wargame \nthe loss of custody of a strategic munition or incident/ \naccident.\n8.  If CBRND readiness reporting, training, equipping, and \ncertification requirements are conflicting, this MARADMIN \nwill take precedence until updates in REF A and C are \npublished.  MSC/MEF readiness officers and chiefs, \nassisted by CBRND personnel, will assist subordinate unit \nreadiness officers in the implementation of these \nreporting standards.  Conflicting guidance will be \nreported to the CBRND POCs identified in this MARADMIN.\n9.  Interim guidance will be formalized in future \nrevisions of REF B and REF D where applicable.\n10.  Units are encouraged to contact their respective \nMARFOR/MEF/MSC readiness officers for clarification \nrelated to the content of this MARADMIN.\n11.  Release authorized by Major General Jason L. Morris, \nDirector, Operations Division, Plans, Policies, and \nOperations.//"

This MARADMIN announces the \nimplementation and special enrollment period for the Health Care\nFederal Flexible Spending Account (HCFSA) Program for active-duty\nand active-reserve Marines.     \n2.  Background.  On 13 September 2024, Secretary of Defense \nMemorandum \u201cOur Enduring Duty to America\u2019s Service Members\nand Their Families\u201d directed the implementation of the HCFSA \nProgram.     \n3.  HCFSA Defined.  HCFSA is an optional benefit that enables\nservice members to use pretax earnings to pay for eligible health\ncare expenses. Each service member can contribute between $100.00\nto $3,300.00 per year to their account.  Households with dual \nmilitary couples can maintain two separate accounts and contribute a\ncombined total of $6,600.00 per year.  Service members must use and \nclaim the funds in their HCFSA account by the end of the plan year.\nWhile you can carry over up to $660.00 of unused funds to the next \nyear if you re-enroll in the HCFSA Program, any remaining funds will\nbe forfeited.      \n4.  Ineligible Expenses.  HCFSA cannot be used to pay for health \ninsurance, life insurance, long term care insurance or any other\ninsurance premiums, or costs for temporary continuation of coverage\n(TCC). \n5.  Eligibility.  To be eligible for enrollment in the HCFSA,\nMarines must be on active-duty or active-reserve with an expectation\nof being on active duty no less than six months of the effective \ncalendar year.   \n6.  Enrollment period.  HCFSA will be available to service members\nfor the first time through a special enrollment period from 3 March\nto 31 March 2025.  Service members can enroll online through the \nFederal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS)at \nhttps:(slash)(slash)www.fsafeds.com. \n6.a.  Upon enrollment, Marines can access the full amount of their\nHCFSA on day one of the plan year.  Payroll deductions for the HCFSA\ncontributions will be deducted in equal increments every pay period\nunless the member chooses to accelerate deductions.   \n6.b.  It is extremely important for Marines to plan and budget\naccordingly when deciding to participate in the HCFSA.  Marines\nmust carefully consider their out-of-pocket medical, dental, \nand vision care expenses prior to electing to participate in the\nHCFSA Program. To obtain funds contributed into a HCFSA account, \nMarines will need to file a claim for reimbursement online through\ntheir FSAFEDS account.  FSAFEDS will reimburse service members with\navailable funds from their HCFSA based upon their elected \nreimbursement preference of either direct deposit or check.        \n7.  Management.  Marines can manage all aspects of their HCFSA\nthrough their FSAFEDS online account https:(slash)(slash)\nwww.fsafeds.com or by downloading the FDAFEDs application to\ntheir personal mobile device.   \n8.  Administration.  Marines must re-enroll each year during open\nseason to continue participation.  Enrollment does not carry forward\nfrom year to year. \n9.  HCFSA Tools.  To assist Commanders and Marines, several HCFSA \ntools can be found on the FSAFED website: https:(slash)(slash)\nwww.fsafeds.com website.  Marines can also contact their local \ninstallation personal financial manager (PFM) or call FSAFEDS \ndirectly toll free at 877-372-3337.  Overseas participants can \ncall toll free at +1 650-577-5294. \n10.  This MARADMIN is applicable to active duty and active \nreserve only.  \n11.

Authority.  Refs (a) through (g) regulate all\nMarine Corps officer promotions.  This message is the authority for\ncommanding officers to effect promotions.  Per the refs, CMC\n(MMPB-10) will not effect an officer's promotion until that\nofficer's name appears on a promotion MARADMIN or CMC message.\nMMPB-10 will mail appropriate commissions to parent commands under\nseparate cover.  Expect 4-6 weeks for delivery.  The commission is\nnot the legal authority to promote and is not required to effect the\npromotion.  For the purposes of conducting a promotion ceremony,\nsample commissions and the oath of office are located in chapter 6\nof ref (b) or the Officer Promotions homepage at www.Marines.mil.\nUnder \"Marines/Career,\" click on \"Promotions.\"  Click on \"Officer\nPromotions,\" look under the \"Reference\" tab on the right side of the\npage.\n2.

Joyce                   29Apr25      KBM \n4.  Delay of Promotion\n4.a.  Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (g), if the\nrespective commanding officer determines that an officer is not\nmentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for\npromotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the\nphysical examination requirement for reserve officers per section\n10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the\nofficer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the\nappointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the\nnotice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers\nmust also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the\nappointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps\nTotal Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of\nadministrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain\nguidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.\n4.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this\npromotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or\npotentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)\nremoved the names of those officers with records identified during\nthe adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially\nadverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN.  Those\nofficers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC\n(JPL).\n5.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary\nretirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to\nacceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion\ncarries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with\naugmentation into the regular component.\n6.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve\nofficer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have\naccepted such promotion on the effective date contained in\nparagraphs 2 and 3 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and\nallowances in the grade to which promoted).

This message updates reference (a) and is a\ncollaborative effort between Deputy Commandants (DC) for Programs\n& Resources (P&R) and Installations & Logistics (I&L) with the\npurpose of enhancing the implementation of DAI CUEC 9, hereby\nreferred to as SOD controls.  To manage risk effectively, comply with\ncontrol standards, and achieve its financial statement audit goals,\nthe Marine Corps must ensure that users with DAI access only have the\nnecessary permissions required to perform their job functions.\n2.  Effectively immediately, all commands at levels 1-4 in DAI must\nresolve all identified SOD conflicts by either removing conflicting\nresponsibilities from users or obtaining waivers from the designated\nauthority.  \n3.  As part of continuing actions, Commands will be required to\nsupport requests for information arising from the monthly review of\nSOD reports (Application Access Controls Governor and the\nTransactions Controls Governor reports).  As part of this review, the\nP&R Systems and Data Integration (SDI) Division and the I&L Logistics\nCompliance Branch (LPC) will coordinate with applicable Commands to\nremediate identified SOD incidents.\n4.  Removing Conflicts.  L1-L4 Commands must assess users\u2019 current\nDAI responsibilities and compare them to job requirements. Any\nidentified conflict or unnecessary responsibilities must be removed\nby coordinating with the P&R User Management (UMX) Section. \n5.  Waivers.  Some commands lack the personnel to distribute\n responsibilities between users per SOD requirements.  Therefore, the\n Marine Corps has a waiver process to balance operational needs\nagainst compliance with control standards.\n6.  The SDI Division and the LPC Branch identified and reviewed\napplicable SOD conflicts.  They ranked each conflict using a\ncomprehensive review that assessed four risk criteria (fraud, audit,\noperations, and personable identifiable information). The analysis\nresulted in the following five risk categories and waiver paths:\n6.a.  Minimal risk conflicts will be adjudicated via an\nenterprise-wide waiver, and thus Commands are not required to address\nthem.\n6.b.  Low risk conflicts will be adjudicated via waivers signed by\nthe first General Officer in the chain of command.\n6.c.  Medium risk conflicts will be adjudicated via HQMC waivers. The\nSDI Director will adjudicate waivers for Financial Management (FM)\nand Oracle and Time Labor (OTL) personnel. The LPC Branch Head will\nadjudicate waivers for Other Government personnel. \n6.d.  High risk conflicts will be adjudicated via HQMC waivers. The\nAssistant Deputy Commandant P&R (Resources) will adjudicate waivers\nfor FM and OTL personnel.  The Assistant Deputy Commandant I&L\nLogistics Division will adjudicate waivers for Other Government\npersonnel.\n6.e.  Waivers will not be granted for zero-tolerance risk conflicts.\n7.  Waiver Instructions\n7.a.  The SOD matrix, the risk register, waiver templates, and\nadditional resources are available at https://usmc.sharepoint-mil.us/\nsites/DCPR_SDI/Risk_Compliance/\n7.a.1.  The SOD matrix provides a summarized view of the identified\nrestricted role combinations.\n7.a.2.  The risk register provides a detailed view of SOD conflicts\nand the risk designation.\n7.a.3.  The waiver templates document the authorization for users to\nmaintain SOD conflicts. There is a waiver template for each\nidentified low, medium, and high-risk SOD conflict. \n7.b.  When users request a new responsibility through the access\nmanagement system (i.e., ARMS), the system will identify if the new\nresponsibility causes an SOD conflict, which requires a waiver to\nproceed.  Users must coordinate with their respective Command\nInformation Owners (IO) to initiate and submit waivers. \n7.c.  Command IOs must complete and submit to the designated\nauthority a waiver request for each SOD conflict identified.\n7.c.1.  For low-risk SOD conflict, Commands should leverage their\ninternal processes to submit and approve waivers.\n7.c.2.  For medium and high-risk SOD conflict, Command IOs must\nsubmit waivers using the Tier 1 Helpdesk JIRA process.\n7.d.  Users must upload the approved waiver to their profile in the\naccess management system.  The P&R UMX Section will validate the waivers. \n7.e.  If the request for a waiver is denied, the conflicting\nresponsibility will not be granted or if it had already been granted,\nit will be removed.\n8. When implementing the waivers, the following apply:\n8.a.  HQMC will evaluate and qualify the risk each SOD conflict poses\nto the enterprise annually and may result in conflicts being assigned\nto a different risk category.\n8.b.  Waivers are subject to periodic reviews to ensure their\ncontinued relevance and effectiveness. They may be revoked or\nmodified if it is determined that the risk level has changed or if\ncompliance issues are identified. \n8.c.  Waivers are not automatically granted and will be voided when\npersonnel are reassigned.\nThe Marine Corps reserves the right to remove user responsibilities\nas necessary.  All users must \nadhere to any mitigating controls established to minimize associated\nrisks. Regular reviews and audits will be conducted to ensure\ncompliance.  \n8.d.  All DAI users have a fiduciary responsibility inherent in their\nroles as stewards of government resources and must report SOD\nconflicts and responsibilities that are no longer required to their\nrespective IOs.\n9.  For specific questions, contact the following POCs:\n9.1.  FM personnel: Mr. Robert Burnand and Ms. Shajuana Nicholson.\n9.2.  All Other Government personnel: Ms. Sheila Warren.\n9.3.  OTL: Ms. Jessica Lynard-Kongkiat and Ms. Cheryl Dabrio.\n10.  This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force.\n11.  Release authorized by Anna N. K. Smith, Assistant Deputy\nCommandant for Programs and Resources (R), and BGen F. C. Poole, III,\nAssistant Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics (LP).//"

This MARADMIN updates policy for Marine Corps\nRecruiters and Liaisons regarding Armed Forces Classification\nTest (AFCT) retesting and waiver requests.\n2. Background. Per reference (a), prior policy restricted\nRecruiters and Liaisons to a single retest while assigned to\nrecruiting duty, requiring Marine Corps Recruiting Command (MCRC)\nG-3 and Headquarters Marine Corps Test Control (MPA) approval.\nRetesting was prohibited within six months of reassignment, and\nwaivers for early retests were not authorized.\n3. General. Effective immediately, Recruiters and Liaisons will\nfollow the same AFCT retest policy as the Fleet Marine Force per\nreferences (a) and (b). The following restrictions are rescinded:\n3.a. The one-time retest limit while on recruiting duty.\n3.b. Requirement for MCRC G-3 approval before MPA authorization.\n3.c. Six-month waiting period after reassignment.\n4. Retest Request Process\n4.a. Standard Retest. Marines may test once every six months\nwithout a waiver but no more than twice per calendar year. All\nretests require a Command Authorization Letter (see 4a).\n4.b. Waivered Retest. A waiver request to test before six months\n(but no sooner than 90 days) requires:\n4.b.1. A letter from the first O-5 Commander in the Marine\u2019s chain\nof command (District Commanding Officer for Recruiters and\nLiaisons).\n4.b.2. A certificate of completion from an approved preparatory\ncourse (see 4c).\n4.b.3. MPA approval.\n4.c. Exceptions. In cases beyond a Marine\u2019s control (e.g., MOS\nclosure, deployment), the training certificate requirement is\nwaived.\n4.d. Restrictions. Waiver requests for tests before 90 days will\nnot be considered.\n5. Approved Preparatory Course Certificates for Waiver Requests:\n5.a. DANTES: https:(slash)(slash)dantes.peterson.com\n5.b. March2Success: https:(slash)(slash)www.march2success.com\n6. Per reference (a), any courses or materials that directly train\nto the AFCT, including the FAST Army Test and Basic Skills\nEducation Program, are prohibited.\n7. In accordance with MCO 1230.5C (Classification Testing),\nMarines who compromise AFCT integrity will be reported to MPA\nand their command will conduct an investigation. Findings will\nbe reviewed for adjudication by the District Commanding Officer\nwith MCRC G-3 endorsement.\n8. Submit requests or questions to MPA at\nSMB_manpower.msab.test@usmc.mil.\n9.

This MARADMIN announces the establishment of Non-\ncovered Assisted Reproductive Technology (NCART) and provides\nimplementation guidance, including Permissive Temporary Additional\nDuty (PTAD) and authorized travel allowances, as directed by the\nOffice of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and\nReadiness. NCART travel allowances are detailed in reference (b).\nFuture revisions of references (c) and (d) will incorporate these\nchanges.\n2.  Effective immediately, commanders should grant NCART PTAD or\ntravel and transportation entitlements for NCART, as outlined in\nthis MARADMIN.\n3.  Commanders remain responsible for meeting operational\nrequirements while ensuring the health and safety of personnel under\ntheir care.  Commanders will continue to display objectivity,\ncompassion, and discretion when addressing healthcare matters.\nThey are also responsible for enforcing existing policies regarding\ndiscrimination and retaliation in the context of reproductive\ntechnology.\n4.  Consistent with existing law and policy, commanders will protect\nthe privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI) received under\nthis MARADMIN.  PHI will be restricted to personnel with a specific\nneed-to-know for the conduct of official duties.  Personnel are also\naccountable for safeguarding this information.\n5.  Only the following components of Assisted Reproductive\nTechnology pertain to the policy and entitlements outlined in this\nMARADMIN:\n    a.  Ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval, including medications\nand procedures required for retrieval, processing, and utilization\nfor ART or cryopreservation\n    b.  Sperm collection and processing for ART or cryopreservation\n    c.  Intrauterine insemination (IUI)\n    d.  In vitro fertilization (IVF)\n6.  NCART PTAD\n    a.  Eligibility.  Active-duty Marines, including Reserve Marines\non active-duty orders for 30 or more consecutive days, are eligible\nto receive NCART PTAD.  Service members are also eligible to\naccompany a dependent or dual-military spouse receiving NCART without\nbeing charged leave.\n    b.  Duration and Documentation. NCART PTAD may not exceed 21\ndays per request and will be limited to the minimum number of days\nnecessary to receive the required care and complete travel.  The\ntravel must be by the most expedient means practicable.  Commanders\nwill limit the health information required to verify eligibility and\nensure authorized time meets these criteria.  This may include, but\nis not limited to, a recommendation from the Unit Medical Officer\n(UMO) or a Department of Defense (DoD) Health Care Provider (HCP)\nconfirming eligibility and the duration of the medical service or\nprocedure.  NCART PTAD is intended to maximize privacy protection\nfor the Marine receiving the NCART service or procedure.\n    c.  Commander\u2019s Authority and Guidance.  Commanders should grant\nNCART PTAD to Marines when a need for NCART is identified by the\neligible Marine.  Requests for NCART PTAD should be given full\nconsideration and should be granted to the greatest extent\npracticable, unless the commander determines the Marine\u2019s absence\nwould impair mission execution.  This PTAD should be granted\nregardless of whether such care is available at the Marine\u2019s\npermanent duty station (PDS) or whether the dependent or dual-\nmilitary spouse resides with or is geographically separated from\nthe eligible Marine.\n        (1) Commanders will act promptly and with appropriate\ndiscretion when considering requests for NCART PTAD.  Delays in\ngranting PTAD should not result in an eligible Marine being unable\nto access the NCART that served as the basis for the PTAD request.\n        (2) Commanders will coordinate with Marines who anticipate\nrecurring requests for NCART PTAD to balance operational\nrequirements and healthcare schedules. Marines are expected to\ninform their command of planned recurring requests.\n        (3) Commanders may grant convalescent leave, in accordance\nwith reference (d), following an NCART service or procedure based\non a recommendation from a DoD HCP or a non-DoD HCP providing care\nto the Marine.\n    d.  Limitations\n        (1) Commanders or leave approving authorities will not levy\nadditional requirements on the eligible Marine (including, but not\nlimited to, consultations with a chaplain, medical testing, or\ncounseling) before processing the NCART PTAD request.\n        (2) NCART PTAD will not be granted to Marines who intend to\nsell, offer for sale, or receive proceeds from the sale resulting\nfrom an ART procedure while on, or in connection with, such absence.\n    e.  Marines are encouraged to meet with their UMO or DoD HCP to\ndiscuss potential work limitations following an NCART service/\nprocedure and to inform their command of these limitations to ensure\nproper planning for recovery. Commanders will not deny an NCART PTAD\nrequest based solely on these limitations.\n    f.  If a Marine or dependent decides against proceeding with\nNCART, the Marine will not have the time away charged as leave and\nwill expeditiously return to their unit.\n7.  NCART Travel and Transportation Allowances\n    a.  Eligibility.  Active-duty Marines and Reserve Component\nMarines on active-duty orders for 180 days or more, along with\ndependents of Marines, may be eligible for travel and transportation\nallowances when timely access to NCART is not available within the\nlocal area of the Marines PDS or Temporary Duty (TDY) location.\nReceiving care may be authorized when the NCART procedure is\nconfirmed by documentation from the licensed health care provider\nor clinic performing the ART services.\n    b.  Eligible Marines and their dependents may choose their\npreferred medical facility for an NCART service or procedure.\nHowever, travel reimbursement is limited to the cost of reaching the\nclosest available medical facility providing the NCART procedure.\n    c.   The command authorizing the travel is responsible for\ntravel funding and must adhere to fiscal regulations.  Travel cannot\nbe approved without available funds.  All leadership levels will\nsupport this policy and prioritize resource allocations accordingly.\nCommands facing funding concerns should collaborate with their chain\nof command and budget offices for assistance.\n    d.  If a Marine or their dependent decides against proceeding\nwith the NCART service or procedure after travel has commenced,\nthe Marine should expeditiously return to duty, and travel funds\nwill not be recouped.\n8.  Administrative Requirements and Command Tracking Procedures\n    a.  Marines requesting NCART PTAD will use the Leave and Liberty\nmodule of Marine Online, selecting Type \u201cPTAD, Other\u201d and writing\n\u201cNon-covered Assisted Reproductive Technology\u201d in the comments\nsection.\n    b.  Command Tracking.  The Marine Corps is required to report\nthe cost and usage of NCART PTAD and funded travel as authorized by\nreferences (a) and (d).  Upon completion of NCART PTAD travel,\ncommands will complete the NCART Tracker for all Service members\nand dependents, regardless of branch of service, by accessing the\nfollowing Manpower and Reserves Affairs link via https://\nwww2.manpower.usmc.mil/tracker/.  Select the \u201cNon-Covered Assisted\nReproductive Technology\u201d tracker, then \u201cCreate New\u201d and fill out\nthe applicable information.

Marines must also use the \nmedical submission instructions on the website to ensure all medical\nrequirements and timeframes are met.\n3.c.  Application must be in the same order as checklist to include\nrequired added documents.  DO NOT include master brief sheets in \napplication or documents not listed on checklist.  Signed checklist \nmust also be included with the application as the first page.  \nApplication and medical must be submitted as two separate PDF files.  \nBoth should be labeled as follows:\n     EDIPI_Last Name Program App (1234567890_Marine MECEP App)\n     EDIPI_Last Name Program Med (0987654321_Officer ECP Med)\n3.d.  The primary way for Marines to submit both their applications \nand medical is via the url: \nhttps:(slash slash)forms.osi.apps.mil/r/3bFx6VcBx4. \nThe website can also be found by visiting: https: \n(slash slash)www.mcrc.marines.mil/Marine-\nOfficer/Officer-Naval-Enlisted-Applicants/ and select the \u201cEnlisted \nto Officer Commissioning\u201d tab. Once on that webpage, scroll down to\n\u201cApplication Submission\u201d to access the submission portal. Common \nAccess Card (CAC) is required to access the application submission \nportal. \n3.e.  If the website is inaccessible, the secondary way for Marines\nto submit both their applications and medical is in DOD SAFE at \nwww.safe.apps.mil to the OMB e_oboard@marines.usmc.mil.  Both should\nbe sent in one DOD Safe drop off as this system allows larger and \nmultiple files to be sent at one time.  Common Access Card (CAC) is \nrequired.  DO NOT password protect the PDF files prior to uploading.  \nUse the 'drop off option' and follow the directions to upload and \nsubmit.  At a minimum, check both the \"encrypt every file\" and \n\"send me an email when each recipient picks up the file\" boxes on \nthe right side.  This allows Personally Identifiable Information \n(PII) to be sent and informs the sender when the application is \npicked up by the recipient.  Encryption will require you to create a \npassphrase.  Marines are directed to provide the passphrase \nseparately to the OMB email and label the subject line \n\"DOD Safe passphrase\".  DO NOT list any other information (EDIPI, \nPII, name) or punctuation within the passphrase email other than \nthe passphrase as it initiates error emails stating PII has been \ndetected.  \n3.f.  In the event DOD SAFE will not accommodate your submission the\ntertiary option submit an application is by sending the application \nand medical files via unencrypted email to \ne_oboard@marines.usmc.mil.  Attachments must not exceed a combined \nfile size of 10MB to be accepted by the MCRC email server; this must\nbe used as a very last option.  The attachments must be password \nprotected, and password must be included in the email.  Password \nmust be the same for both files.  \n3.g.  DO NOT send submissions more than once.  MCRC will provide \nconfirmation of package receipt within 10 working days of the \napplication deadline.\n4.  This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force.\n5.  The POCs for this MARADMIN are Capt Monique Devitt and Ms. \nTroi Spencer.  Please refer to POC information at the beginning of \nthis MARADMIN.  For email correspondence, email organizational \nmailbox e_oboard@marines.usmc.mil.\n6.  Release authorized by Major General William J. Bowers, \nCommanding General, Marine Corps Recruiting Command.//"

Purpose.  This MARADMIN provides interim \nguidance and announces upcoming policy changes regarding exceptions\nto policy (ETP) for uniform and grooming standards based on a \nmedical condition.  The strength of the Marine Corps has always\nbeen its people.  Ensuring the health, resilience, and discipline \nof our Marines and Sailors is essential to sustaining our \nwarfighting capability and maintaining the high standards required\nto remain ready for any challenge.  These standards ensure we remain\nthe world\u2019s premier fighting force, ready to fight and win with \nunwavering readiness, discipline, and lethality.   \n2.  Background.  All personnel authorized to wear the Marine Corps\nuniform must comply with Marine Corps uniform and grooming standards\nper reference (b).  Medical conditions may necessitate temporary \nmodifications.  Examples include a Service member recovering from\nsurgery requiring a brace or sling, a Service member diagnosed with\nPseudofolliculitis Barbae (PFB) or other facial skin conditions/\nwounds needing to temporarily refrain from clean-shaving, or an \ninjured Service member requiring alternative footwear.   \n3.  Immediate Action:   \n3.a.  Military Medical Officers (MO): When a medical procedure or\ncondition necessitates modifying a Service member\u2019s uniform or \ngrooming standards, as defined by reference (b), the MO will provide\na written waiver recommendation for the specific modification(s). \n3.b.  Commanding Officers (CO): COs will review the MO's \nrecommendations and, in consultation with the MO, approve or \ndisapprove the ETP. \n3.c.  Service members with approved ETPs: Affected personnel must\nretain and readily produce a copy of their approved ETP whenever\ndeviating from the standards outlined in reference (b). This ETP may\nbe presented in either hard copy or digital format. \n4. Amplifying Information on PFB.  \n4.a.  PFB is a medical condition that may require modified facial\ngrooming, education, and treatment time.  This interim guidance \nreaffirms existing treatment plans and clarifies commanders'\nresponsibilities in supporting those protocols, with the ultimate\ngoal of returning Service members to grooming standards and ensuring\nmaximum warfighting readiness. \n4.b.  Interim Guidance for Facial Grooming Modifications: \n4.b.1. PFB has a four-phase treatment approach outlined in detail\nin reference (c).  During these phases, a MO may recommend modifying\ngrooming standards and endorse the use of clippers.  The following\nis a summary of each phase: \n4.b.1.a.  Phase I, Control of mild cases:  Avoid shaving for up to\n4 weeks until all lesions have subsided while undergoing medical\ntreatment. \n4.b.1.b.  Phase II, Control of moderate to severe cases or those\ncases unresponsive to Phase I:  Avoid shaving for up to 8 weeks\nif initially starting Phase II or up to an additional 4 weeks if\ncontinuing from Phase I, with hair removal by depilatory treatment\naccording to treatment plan. \n4.b.1.c.  Phase III, Cases Unresponsive to Phase II Treatment:\nContinue Phase II protocols for up to an additional 4 weeks; \nthe MO may then recommend continued treatment based on the patient's\nresponse and, if necessary, a further period of modified grooming\nstandards. \n4.b.1.d.  Phase IV (Optional), Control of cases unresponsive to\nPhase III or recurring frequently: Referral to dermatology for\npossible laser treatment. This treatment is government-funded, \nbut a Service member is not required to undergo laser treatment.  \n4.b.2. Medical Evaluations: As with other medical conditions \nrequiring modified uniform and or grooming standards, MOs will \nrecommend, and COs will approve or disapprove the modification.  \nThis change replaces the previous guidance in reference (a). \n4.b.3. Documentation:\u202f When modified facial grooming standards\nare authorized, NAVMC 11830(02-25) will be used to document the ETP.\nThe new NAVMC aims to improve communication between the member, \nmedical providers, and command teams throughout the four-phase \ntreatment plan. \n4.b.4. Command Monitoring:\u202fCOs with Service members diagnosed \nwith PFB must actively monitor the four-phase treatment plan, \nas outlined in reference (c), to assist the Service member in \nreturning to compliance as defined in reference (b).   \n5.  Administration.  \n5.a. NAVMC Form 11830 (02-25).  This form is not yet available\nthrough standard channel at forms.documentservices.dla.mil.  \nIn the interim, download the draft form from the Manpower & \nReserve Affairs, Manpower Plans & Policy Division, Manpower \nMilitary Policy Branch (MPO) website at https:(slash)(slash)\nwww.manpower.marines.mil/Plans-and-Policies/Manpower-Plans-and-\nPolicy/Manpower-Military-Policy-MPO/Uniform-Grooming-Mods-Related\n-to-Medical-Conditions/.  \n5.b. Administrative Separation.  Marines needing a uniform or \ngrooming ETP based on a medical condition for over one year \nmay be considered for administrative separation due to \nincompatibility with Service.   \n6.  Coordinating Instructions: \n6.a.  Within 90 days of this MARADMIN's release, all Service members\nwith a current PFB diagnosis must be re-evaluated by a Medical \nOfficer.  Re-evaluation will assess the Service member's current \ntreatment protocol and determine the need for further treatment.\nIf the MO determines that the Service member's condition warrants\nan ETP, the MO will use the revised NAVMC to facilitate \ncommunication between the Service member, medical, and COs. \n6.b.  Effective immediately, this MARADMIN supersedes reference\n(a) and aligns the treatment of PFB with all other medical \nconditions impacting modifications to uniform and/or grooming \nstandards. \n7.  The changes in this MARADMIN will be incorporated into a \nforthcoming Marine Corps Order. \n8. This message applies to the Marine Corps Total Force. \n9. Release authorized by Brigadier General David R. Everly, \nDirector, Manpower Plans and Policy Division.//"

Situation.  This message signals the culmination of\ninitiatives to establish a USMC program of record for\nService level enterprise-wide Force Management,\nestablishing the means to support data-driven resourcing\ndecisions through the automation and organization of massive\namounts of critical data required to organize and employ\nforces. Mobile Training Teams (MTT) will be formed to \nsupport the first of a phased system release in the fall of \n2025.\n1.a.  Force Management Tool (FMT) and Slider applications\nwill sunset and be replaced with the Strategic Management\nDecision Support (SMDS) module--Global Synchronization\nAnalysis Management Planning System (GSAMPS) for utilization\nduring the October 2025 Force Synchronization Forum.\n1.b.  Future, iterative system releases will begin in late\n2025/early 2026 to include personnel data and enhanced \nanalytic support; separate message traffic will address the \ndetailed system fielding plan, virtual training guides, \nMarine Net and additional MTT feasibility support.\n1.c. Decisions to further develop joint interfaces,\nintegrated reserve activation data, among other initiatives\nare pending.\n2. Mission. Inform stakeholders of SMDS (GSAMPS)\ncapability, statutory foundation, strategic baseline and \nplan to implement MTTs during the August through \nSeptember 2025 timeframe, for select G-S3/G-S5/G-7 \nusers at MEFs and MARFORS.\n2.a. Capability\n2.a.1. SMDS (GSAMPS) will serve as a \u201clive\u201d Global \nForce Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP), enabling\nMARFORs and MEFs to register, source and track changes\nto supporting Combatant Commander (CCDR) operational,\nexercise and training requirements, in addition to Service \ndirected activities and training.\n2.a.2. System capabilities will be released in a \nphased approach, first integrating data from\nauthoritative legacy structure, manpower and readiness\nsystems, aligned to CCDR and Service demand for\ncapabilities. \n2.a.3. SMDS (GSAMPS) will bridge the gap between\nUSMC Title Ten forces offering, force/institutional risk \nassessment decisions and JS/OSD perspectives of USMC\nforce availability-by providing a system to enable:\n2.a.3.a. Force providers to align duty status of deployable\npopulations during sourcing solution/risk to force \ndevelopment as requirements contract and expand, \nor combat losses impact force generation.\n2.a.3.b. Service Headquarters to assess small to large\nscale total force impacts, particularly as modernization\nefforts affect sustainment, combat losses impact force\ngeneration and changes to mobilization authorities. \n2.b. Statutory Foundation\n2.b.1. Ref a directed the development of a Joint Force \nActivities Dataset (JFAD). JFAD links Global Force \nManagement (GFM) employment/deployment data to \nplanning activities in the Joint Capabilities Requirements \nManager (JCRM) database, enabling Service deployment \ndata to be accessed for studies supporting the development\nand implementation of defense strategy and DoD PPBE \nactivities.\n2.b.2. Ref b identified the Service imperative to develop\na strategic management tool, automating data feeds and \nanalytic capabilities to provide holistic visibility and \nnear real-time situational awareness to organize and \ncomprehend massive amounts of critical data, across the \nenterprise, needed to inform senior leader decisions.\n2.b.3. Ref c established public law requiring the Secretary\nof Defense to direct the development and implementation \nof a plan to strengthen analytic capabilities, specifically\ninforming decision-making capabilities necessary to \nimplement the National Defense Strategy. \n2.b.4. Refs d-f set conditions to develop and implement a\nUSMC program of record to serve as a tool to complement\nchanges to GFM, force modernization and inform Senior \nLeaders decisions.\n2.c. Strategic Baseline\n2.c.1. Automates and improves GFM data accuracy, \nintegrating data from legacy systems and enhancing\nInstitutional Readiness Working Group (IRWG) initiatives \nto determine readiness impacts resulting from changes to \noperational demand, force capacity and force modernization.\n2.c.2. Establishes the ability to resolve registered \ncapability gaps to synchronize manpower resourcing\nimpacts (analysis of PERSTEMPO, etc.) with GFM operational\nrequirements, expands visibility of data to confirm risk \nand/or planning assumptions linking current operations with\nfuture force development/design initiatives supporting the\nMarine Corps Force Integration concept.\n2.c.3. Enables visibility of data to support planning\nhorizons between institutional, operational and tactical\nlevels to modernize capabilities while forces are mobilized\nand/or employed. \n2.c.4. Integrates visibility of T/E structure, DRRS \nequipment readiness data and operational requirements \nin a single system.\n2.d. MTT and Follow-On Training Requirements\n2.d.1. MTTs will establish a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d program as\nthe initial effort for key stakeholders to sustain sourcing\nsubmissions in support of the October 2025 Force \nSynchronization Conference.\n2.d.2. MTTs will focus on building train the trainer \ncadre, while user guides and Marine Net training will be\navailable to all. Future phased systems release in late \n2025/early 2026-separate message traffic will address \ntraining support for capability updates.\n3. Execution\n3.a. Commanders intent. To identify MARFORCOM, II MEF,\nMARFORPAC, I MEF, III MEF and MARFORRES personnel \nresponsible for establishing a training program\nto sustain sourcing related to GFM tasks.\n4. Concept of operations. PP&O will form a MTT to\nsupport (5) \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d sessions. Each command\nwill be required to provide space and SIPR computers \nto support designated parent command trainers and MTT \npersonnel for a 3-day period within the August through \nSeptember 2025 timeframe.\n4.a.

In accordance with (IAW) the references, this\nmessage identifies initial billet assignments for Reserve First\nSergeants (1stSgts) selected on the FY25 Selected Marine Corps\nReserve (SMCR) First Sergeant Special Promotion Selection Board.\nThis message identifies newly selected 1stSgts approved for an\ninitial 36-month tour.  Per references, promotion allocations were\nbased on actual and projected Billet Identification Codes (BIC)\nvacancies.   Failure to accept assignment to a specified billet will\nresult in revocation of selection to 1stSgt and involuntary transfer\nto the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR).\n2.  1stSgt selectees will be frocked IAW references (a), (e) and (f).\nFrocking is deemed in the best interest of the Marine Corps and\napproved with the understanding that frocked 1stSgts may assume the\ntitle and wear the uniform and rank of 1stSgt respectively, in the\nMarine Corps Reserve, and that no pay, allowances, or entitlements\nwill take effect until the actual date of promotion.  This message\nis the source document to frock selectees prior to detachment from\ntheir current unit.  Frocking will occur no earlier than 60 days\nprior to the report date to the new unit (unless otherwise approved\nby the Director, Reserve Affairs (Dir, RA)).  Requests for approval\nof an adjusted frocking date must be communicated to Reserve Affairs\n(RA SgtMaj) via the chain of command utilizing a NAVMC 10274\n(AA form).  Units will ensure a copy of this message is placed into\nthe Marine's OMPF until the actual date of promotion.\n3.  Assignments of newly selected 1stSgts are for 36 months.\nHowever, tours may be adjusted based on the needs of the Marine\nCorps.  Upon receipt of this message, Marines are directed to begin\ntransfer coordination and prepare an inter-unit transfer (IUT)\nrequest in the Requirements Transition and Manpower Management System\n(RTAMMS) for RA approval.  This message serves as the authority to\napprove the IUT request of the newly selected Marine to the approved\nReporting Unit Code (RUC).  In no case shall commanders recommend\nthe transfer of any 1stSgt to any other billet than those listed\nbelow without prior written approval from the Dir, RA.  The IUT\nrequest must be submitted in advance to allow timely processing by\nRA and to prevent issues with Inactive Duty Training (IDT) Travel\nReimbursement.\n4.  Once the IUT is approved by RA in RTAMMS and upon joining the\ngaining command, the assignment of the 1stSgt BIC will be\nadministered via RTAMMS.  Selected Marines must be joined to their\nnewly directed RUC to be placed in the HQMC RA directed BIC.  Only\na 1stSgt may fill a respective 8999 BIC per reference (h).  The\noutgoing Marine is required to be placed into EX009 per reference\n(h).  If eligible, both the outgoing and incoming 1stSgt will remain\neligible for IDT Travel Reimbursement, not to exceed a turnover\nperiod of 90 days.  The unit will contact Marine Forces Reserve,\nG-1 Manpower at SMB_IDT_TRAVEL@USMC.MIL to obtain an IDT Travel\nReimbursement Waiver for the Marine in excess not to exceed that 90\nday period.  If the outgoing 1stSgt is pending retirement, this\nMarine will be reassigned as EX009 pending release to the Individual\nReady Reserve (IRR) awaiting final retirement.  No later than 90 days\nfrom the day the SgtMaj or 1stSgt has reported, they will be\nadministratively transferred to the IRR, unless prior coordination is\nmade with the RA SgtMaj.\n5.  The report date for all 1stSgts is no earlier than the 1st of the\nmonth and no later than the last day of the month as listed below.\nAdjustments to report dates may be granted with prior coordination\nwith the RA SgtMaj.  In all cases, Marines will contact the gaining\nunit's administrative section and leadership to schedule an exact\nreport date and ensure proper turnover procedures are completed.\n6.

This applies when\nstaying in the vicinity of the old or new PDS, home of record,\ninitial technical school, or a designated place during a PCS move.\n4.  Reimbursement Limits.  The maximum daily TLE reimbursement rate\nis $290.  Reimbursement is based on the locality per diem rate, the\nnumber and ages of dependents, and the actual lodging expenses\nincurred by the Marine or dependents, at the PDS, designated place,\nhome of record, or initial technical school. Prior to occupying\ncommercial lodging, Marines must use available Government quarters,\nas outlined in reference (b). However, this requirement does not\napply to designated places.  For example, a Marine on an\nunaccompanied or dependent restricted tour Outside the Continental\nUnited States (OCONUS) may elect to leave their dependents at a\nCONUS location of their choosing\u2014a designated place.  In this\nexample, the Marine is not required to use Government quarters when\nclaiming TLE at the designated place, however, they must use\nGovernment quarters when claiming TLE at the new PDS, if available.\n5.  TLE claim examples:\n5.a.  A Marine conducts a PCS between two CONUS PDSs. The Marine\noccupies temporary quarters at the new PDS from 1-21 April, claiming\nthose dates for TLE. Their spouse and child remain at the old PDS,\noccupying temporary quarters from 22 April to 12 May, for which the\nMarine also claims TLE. The Marine certifies that Government\nquarters were unavailable at both locations. While the Marine can\nclaim per diem for both locations during these periods, they will\nonly be reimbursed for a maximum of 21 total days of TLE at a rate\nof $290 per day (a maximum of $6,090).  If a Service member's\nclaimed expenses exceed their authorized TLE reimbursement, they\nwill be responsible for the difference.\n5.b.  Two Service members married to each other with two children\nrelocate on PCS orders between two CONUS PDSs. Each Service member\nis authorized a maximum of 21 days of TLE, limited to $290 per day,\n(a maximum of $6,090 for each service member). Both Service members,\nwith their dependents, occupy temporary quarters before and after\nreporting to the new PDS. After certifying that Government quarters\nwere unavailable, each Service member may independently claim TLE\nfor a period of up to 21 days. These 21-day periods may not overlap.\nFor example:  Service member (1) claims TLE for themselves and the\ntwo children from 1-21 April.  Service member (2) claims TLE for\nthemselves and the two children from 22 April \u2013 12 May.  If a\nService member's claimed expenses exceed their authorized TLE\nreimbursement, they will be responsible for the difference.\n5.c. Additional TLE examples can be at https://www.travel.dod.mil\n/Portals/119/Documents/JTR/CE/CE-MPDT-17.pdf.\n6.  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), can be found at https://\nwww.travel.dod.mil/Support/ALL-FAQs/Article/3174593/temporary-\nlodging-expenses/.\n7.  This MARADMIN is applicable to Marines/Sailors in an active duty\nstatus.\n8.  Release authorized by Lieutenant General Michael J. Borgschulte,\nDeputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//"

Pursuant to Title 10, U.S.C. Section 614(b) or\n14106, eligible officers are personally responsible for ensuring CMC \n(MMPB-10) has received their personal correspondence to the \nPresident of the Board NLT 2359 Eastern Standard Time (EST), 10 \ncalendar days prior to the board convene date of their respective \nboard to be considered. This is a statutory requirement and cannot \nbe waived.  Late correspondence will not be accepted under any \ncircumstances. See paragraph 8 below for instructions on how to \nsubmit.\n** For promotion to the grade of captain, a promotion selection \nboard will not be convened.  Instead, eligible officers will undergo\nan All-Fully-Qualified-Officers List (AFQOL) process.  The official \nmilitary records of all officers eligible for promotion to captain \nwill be screened to identify those officers fully qualified for \npromotion to captain. Those officers determined not fully qualified\nfor promotion will be omitted from the AFQOL and incur a failure of\nselection (FOS).  The provisions set forth in this MARADMIN are \napplicable to AFQOL process, to include reviewing and preparing \nrecords for promotion consideration and submission of \ncorrespondence.  \n2.  MARADMINs announcing the established dates of rank (DOR) for the\npromotion zones will be published approximately 30 to 60 days prior \nto each scheduled board.  Upon announcement, officers may determine \ntheir eligibility status by reviewing references (a) and (b).  \nReference (a) provides a lineal list of all officers in the Marine \nCorps and reference (b) discusses eligibility.  Officers with \nquestions regarding their eligibility for a board or their status \nin reference (a) should contact the lineal staff, Commandant of the\nMarine Corps (CMC), Manpower Management Performance Branch, Officer\nPromotion Unit (MMPB-10). Unless otherwise noted in the convening\nmessage, all officer promotion boards will take place at 2008 Elliot\nRoad, Quantico, VA 22134.\n3.  Continuation selection boards.  The convening of continuation \nselection boards will be announced in the MARADMIN announcing the \npromotion zones, as applicable, based on SECNAV-approved \ncontinuation plans for this fiscal year.  Officers are advised that\ncontinuation boards are convened based on the needs of the Marine \nCorps and selection criteria may vary from year to year.\n4.  Eligibility for consideration for promotion.  Time-in-grade \n(TIG) and other requirements.\n4.a.  Officers may not be considered for promotion to the next \nhigher grade in any zone until the officers complete the minimum TIG\nas specified below.  The minimum TIG may be waived based on the \nneeds of the Marine Corps, except in the case of chief warrant \nofficers (CWO).  \nGrade                  Considered For Selection To    TIG\nBrigadier General      Major General                  1 year \nColonel                Brigadier General              1 year\nLieutenant Colonel     Colonel                        3 years \nMajor                  Lieutenant Colonel             3 years \nCaptain                Major                          3 years \nFirst Lieutenant       Captain                        no minimum \nCWO 2, 3, 4            CWO 3, 4, 5                    2 years \nThere is no time in grade requirement for First Lieutenants to be\nconsidered for promotions. However, First Lieutenants must attain 2\nyears time in grade before promotion to Captain.  This information\nprovides officers with an approximate indication of when they may \nexpect to be considered for promotion.  An officer's eligibility for\nconsideration for promotion is determined as of the date the board\nconvenes.  If an officer's DOR is such that he or she will meet the\nminimum TIG by the convening date of the board, then the officer is\nadvised to prepare for consideration and ensure ample time for \nreview of their record.  Information on preparing for a promotion\nboard is available at the officer promotion homepage.\n4.b. Retirement and Separation.   With the exception of the USMC \nCaptain AFQOL, the Marine Corps will also request authority\nfrom SECNAV to preclude from consideration officers with an \nestablished separation date that is within 90 days after the date \nthe board convenes. \n4.c.  One-year rule for Reserve Officers.  Reserve officers are \neligible for consideration for promotion if, on the date the board \nconvenes, the officers have continuously performed service on either\nthe RASL or the active-duty list (ADL) (or a combination of both \nlists) for one year.  Service on the RASL includes service in the \nReady Reserve (AR, SMCR, IMA, and IRR) and in an active status of \nthe Standby Reserve.\n4.d.  U.S. Citizenship.  An officer on the ADL in the grade of \nCaptain who is not a U.S. citizen may not be considered for \npromotion to the grade of Major.\n5.  Deferment of eligibility.  Marine Corps Officers who would be \neligible for consideration by a promotion selection board (PSB) as\nan in-zone or above-zone eligible officer within one year of \nplacement on the ADL shall be informed that their eligibility for \nsuch consideration will be deferred unless they specifically \nrequest consideration.  The officer may waive this deferment and \nrequest consideration for promotion, in writing, as specified in \nthe MARADMIN which announced the officer's eligibility.  Requests\nmust be received no later than the convening date of the board. \nThe Deputy Commandant (DC), Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA) \nshall normally place such officers' records before the PSB.\n6.  Opt out of Consideration.  See reference (c) for instructions \nand deadlines on submission of opt-out requests.\n7.  Personal responsibilities.  Each officer is personally \nresponsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of their \nOfficial Military Personnel File (OMPF) and Master Brief Sheet (MBS)\nbefore the date the board convenes. The most expeditious means\nof obtaining and viewing the OMPF and MBS is through the OMPF-Record\nManagement Application (O-RMA). Refer to reference (d) to determine \nwhat documents are appropriate for inclusion in the OMPF.  Officers \nshould verify any additions or deletions from their OMPF or MBS \nwithin the 12-month window to ensure the accuracy and completeness \nof their record.  \n7.a.  OMPF document submission timelines. With the exception of \nfitness reports, all OMPF documents, should be forwarded to and\nreceived by CMC (MMPB-22) two weeks prior to the convening date of\nthe selection board in order to allow processing time to the OMPF.  \nBoard eligible records continue to be updated until the convening \ndate of the board, however, officers must submit all material no \nlater than two weeks prior to the board for which they are eligible.\n7.b.  Career Counselors.  Active-duty officers may conduct a self-\naudit of personal records via the self-audit document guide or \nthrough the link at the Marine Online/myOMPF/about OMPF tab.  Career\ncounseling for officers is now done by Officer Assignments (MMOA).\nReserve officers may contact Reserve Affairs, Career Management \nTeam (CMT), who will provide OMPF review and career counseling for\nall members of the Reserve Component (AR, SMCR, IMA, IRR). To \nrequest counseling services, e-mail to smb_manpower_cac@usmc.mil \nwith your name, EDIPI, contact information, and the service you are \nrequesting.  More information can be found by accessing their \nwebsite at \"www.manpower.usmc.mil/webcenter/portal/CMT/pages_home.\"\n7.c.  Fitness reports.  Fitness reports are due to CMC (MMPB-23) \nby the timelines noted in reference (e).  Reports mailed directly \nto the President of the Board will not be added to a Marine\u2019s OMPF.\nFor fitness reports to become part of the OMPF, the reports must be\nsubmitted to CMC (MMPB-23).  The automated performance evaluation \nsystem (A-PES) is the primary means of submitting fitness reports, \nhowever, reporting officials may email PDF copies to the MMPB-2 \norganizational mailbox at hqmc.fitrep.processing@usmc.mil, so \nlong as the mailer\u2019s email account can be confirmed as either the \nreporting senior\u2019s or reviewing officer\u2019s .mil email address.  If \nmailing a paper version of a report to HQMC, it is imperative that\nthe forwarding envelope is conspicuously marked \"contains FITREPs \nfor FY27 (appropriate board) selection board.\"  Timely submission of\nfitness reports is critical for board eligible members as CMC \n(MMPB-23) will need time to review reports for accuracy and \ncompliance.  Commanders are ultimately responsible for the timely\nsubmission of fitness reports to CMC (MMPB-23) and ensuring all \nfitness report timelines noted in reference (e) are adhered to.\n7.c.1.  Date gaps must be corrected IAW chapter 8 and appendix F \nof reference (e).  If missing reports are less than one year old, a \nreconstructed original is required.  Copies of the completed fitness\nreports over one year old must have all pages certified as true \ncopies by either reporting officials (RS/RO).  For completion and\nsubmission of reports over one year old, it is preferable that the\noriginal reviewing officer complete the report, however, CMC \n(MMPB-23) may act as the reviewing officer on reports that are not\nadverse on a case by case basis.\n7.c.2.  Marines are reminded that requests for administrative\nchanges to their fitness report records may take up to 30 days to\ncomplete.  Reasonable diligence for records correction timeliness \nrests solely on the Marine making the request.\n7.d.  Professional Military Education (PME).  The selection \nguidance (precepts) for many boards includes a reminder of the \nimportance of PME, whether resident or non-resident, in an officer's\ndevelopment.  Officers are advised to ensure that course completion\ninformation is noted on their MBS and that PME completion \ncertificates are included in their OMPF to illustrate completion.\nIn cases where an officer has not completed PME, but has completed\none or more sub-courses of that PME, the officer may send \ncorrespondence to the President of the Board in accordance with \nparagraph 8 below, describing progress in completing the PME and \ninclude documented evidence of any sub-course completion.  See \nreferences (f) and (g) for additional information regarding PME.  \n7.e.  Civilian education.  All officers must ensure their civilian\neducation is accurately reflected in the Marine Corps Total Force \nSystem (MCTFS).\n8.  Officer Correspondence.  All eligible officers are encouraged, \nbut are not required, to submit correspondence to the President of \nthe Board. OMPF materials sent directly to the President of the \nBoard will not become part of an officer's OMPF.  The following \nguidelines apply to Officer Correspondence:\n8.a. Correspondence Template and Form.  The letter or cover letter\nmust be addressed to: President, FY27 USMC/USMCR (appropriate grade\nand competitive category) promotion selection board. A sample \nletter/cover letter is available at the officer promotion homepage.\n8.b.Cover Letter and Enclosures.  A letter to the board signed by \nthe eligible officer with no additional enclosures does not require \na cover letter.  Correspondence with enclosures must be submitted \nunder a signed cover letter by the eligible officer, with the \nmaterial for the board\u2019s consideration listed as enclosures. Material\nsubmitted without a signed cover letter by the eligible officer will\nnot be made available to the board. Communications or memorandums of\nrecommendation from other parties on behalf of officers eligible for\nconsideration will not be provided to the board unless forwarded as \na listed enclosure under a signed cover letter.\n8.c. Signature.  Letters and cover letters from the eligible officer\nmust be signed either with a pen or with a CAC digital signature by \nthe eligible officer. \n8.d.  Correspondence Submission.  All eligible officers may submit \ncorrespondence to their respective promotion selection board via the\nboard correspondence Portal.     \n8.e. Board Correspondence Portal. Officers must have a valid \nUSMC email to access the board correspondence Portal.  Uploading\nmaterial to the Board Correspondence Portal is the preferred and\nmost accurate submission method. To access the CAC enabled Portal, \ngo to: https://www2.manpower.usmc.mil/application_cac/.  Officers \ncan confirm their submissions via the Portal and WILL NOT receive\nseparate confirmation of receipt from MMPB-10. Access to the Portal\nwill be granted to eligible officers no later than 60 days before \nthe board convene dates established in paragraph 1 of this MARADMIN. \n8.f. Email. Alternatively, officers who do not have access to the \nportal may send their correspondence via email directly to the \norganizational mailbox:officerpromotions@usmc.mil.  Ensure the email\nsubject line reads \"correspondence to the FY27 USMC/USMCR \n(appropriate grade) promotion selection board.\" Documents should be \ntitled as EDIPI_LASTNAME_Document Name.\" Correspondence sent via \nUSMC email will receive an automatic email response, which serves as\nthe official confirmation that CMC (MMPB-10)\nhas received your update material. \n8.g.  Request for Non-Selection.  Officers eligible for promotion \nwho plan to separate or retire may correspond with the President of\nthe Board requesting they not be selected for promotion.  Any \nofficer who writes such a letter to the board will still be \nconsidered for promotion and will incur a failure of selection if \nnot recommended for promotion by the board.  Per Title 10, U.S.C. \nSection 1174, an officer who submits a request not to be selected \nfor promotion, or who otherwise directly causes his or her non-\nselection through written communication to the board, is not \nentitled to separation pay if involuntarily discharged from active \nduty.  This pertains to all active-duty boards, with the exception \nof the CWO board.  Requests for non-selection are subject to officer \ncorrespondence guidance provided in this MARADMIN. \n8.h.  Classified Reports.  Eligible officers whose records contain\nclassified reports should notify CMC, Officer Promotion Unit \n(MMPB-10) as soon as possible.  Notification should include the \nMarines' full name, EDIPI, grade, occasion, and dates of the \nreport(s).   \n9.  In addition to the information in paragraph 8 above, Reserve \nComponent officers should accomplish the following:\n9.a.   Career Retirement Credit Report (CRCR).  The CRCR is \nprovided to reserve boards as a quantitative measure of active \nparticipation.  It is imperative that each officer review his or \nher CRCR.  It is the responsibility of each officer to ensure the \nCRCR is accurate.  Per reference (i), record audits will be \nconducted annually.  Officers should identify discrepancies and \nprovide updating or modifying CRCR information to their Inspector\nInstructor or Commanding Officer during these audits.  Reserve unit\ncommanders will correct discrepancies via the unit diary.  IRR and \nIMA officers will receive an updated CRCR from the Marine Individual\nReserve Support Organization (MIRSO) within 45 days of their \nanniversary date.  The CRCR is also available in MOL under \"personal\ninformation,\" \"Career Retirement Credit Report.\"  Per reference (i),\ncorrections must be annotated and returned with supporting \ndocumentation (muster sheets, orders, historical NAVMC 798s, etc.)\nto MIRSO.  The CRCRs are downloaded from MCTFS five working days \nbefore the date the board convenes and are subsequently provided to\nthe board on the convening date of the board. \n9.b.  Reserve Qualification Summary (RQS).  Per reference (i), \nReserve officers, including Active Reserve (AR), eligible for \nconsideration for promotion are highly encouraged to submit a \ncomplete RQS(NAVMC 10476) as officer correspondence to the board to\narrive not later than 10 calendar days prior to the date the board \nconvenes as outlined above in paragraph 8.  The purpose of the RQS \nis to provide the board with information not included in other \nofficial records or fitness reports.  The RQS must be submitted \nunder a signed cover letter. \n10.  Post-board information and guidance.  Officers may view the \napproval progress of their board from the officer promotion \nhomepage.  When the results of a field grade board are authorized to\nbe released, a \"personal for\" (P-4) email will be forwarded to all \nMarine Corps general officers. The P-4 affords recipients an \nopportunity to ensure each select and in-zone non select are advised\nof their promotion status.  The P-4 includes work phone numbers that\nare obtained from MCTFS.  All officers are required to ensure their \ncontact data is correct in MOL and MCTFS and to verify the accuracy\nof their MCC, unit, billet, phone and email information.  Accurate, \ncurrent contact information will facilitate more efficient \nnotification.  Approximately 5 working days after a P-4 is released,\nSECNAV will release the ALNAV announcing the names of the officers \nselected by the board.  Captain and CWO board results will be \nannounced via ALNAV when the board reports are approved by Secretary\nof Defense (SECDEF).    \n11. This MARADMIN is applicable to all Active and Reserve Component\nofficers.  All eligible officers have an obligation to prepare for \npromotion consideration and are reminded that they have a personal \nresponsibility for the accuracy and completion of their own record. \nCommanding officers shall: \n11.a.  Ensure this MARADMIN and subsequent convening MARADMINs are \navailable to all officers under their command.\n11.b.  Encourage all eligible officers to review their OMPF, MBS, \nand MCTFS data.\n11.c.  Ensure all reporting officials comply with fitness report\ntimelines noted in reference (d).\n11.d.

It is my honor to take a moment to\nrecognize all that you have done and continue to do for your Marine\nCorps.\n2.  Since the establishment of the Navy Civil Engineer Corps in 1842 \nand the Navy\u2019s Civil Engineer Corps in 1867, the Marine Corps has\ngreatly benefited from the faithful stewardship provided by your \norganization's military and civilian staff.  Naval Facilities\nEngineering Systems Command and Civil Engineer Corp officers remain\nvital to the success of Marine Corps installations providing\nefficient facility sustainment and management, executing mission\ncritical construction, and working tirelessly to advance crucial\nquality of life initiatives to provide our Marines the safest and\nmost comfortable environment possible.

Since 1942, the Navy Seabees have been by our side answering our\nnation\u2019s call to crisis.  Eighty years ago, Seabees were building \nand fighting alongside Marines throughout the Pacific, liberating \nGuam, Palau, the Philippines, and other islands as the nation island\nhopped to victory.  To this day, Seabees and Marines train together\non those same islands, conducting readiness exercises, completing\nhumanitarian efforts such as Pacific Partnership, and continuing the\nlong legacy of Seabee-Marine brotherhood.  Together you continue to\nenable our Nation\u2019s readiness to respond to crisis and continue to \nsupport Marines wherever and whenever needed. \n4.  Let us not forget to reflect upon the sacrifices of all Navy\nSeabees and Civil Engineers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in\nservice to our great Nation.  Marines around the world salute your\ndedication, courage, and unshakable resolve.\n5.  I am grateful for everything that the Naval Facilities \nEngineering Systems Command, the men and women of the Civil Engineer\nCorps, and, of course, our cherished brothers and sisters in arms, \nthe United States Seabees, bring to the fight.  On behalf of our\nbeloved Marine Corps, thank you.  Your continued contribution to the\nsea services is vital and will never go unnoticed.\n6.  Happy Birthday to all of our Department of the Navy \nInstallations, facilities and expeditionary partners and \nprofessionals!  \n7.  Semper Fidelis, Eric M.

Execute a phased implementation plan to ensure an organized \ntransition to full operational capability, including:\n3.B.1.A. Phase 1 (Within 15 Days): Conduct Troop-to-Task (T2T) \nanalysis, identify staffing gaps, and assess funding allocations \nthrough a Marine Corps Program Code (MCPC) analysis.\n3.B.1.B. Phase 2 (Within 30 Days): Finalize a Memorandum of \nAgreement (MOA) between MCICOM and Commander, Navy Installations \nCommand (CNIC) for SCP support and begin staffing MCPO with four \nfull-time employees transferred from the Naval Petroleum Office.\n3.B.1.C. Phase 3 (Initial Operational Capability): Secure personnel, \nresources, and office space at Naval Support Facility (NSF) \nArlington, ensuring operational continuity with external agencies.\n3.B.1.D. Phase 4 (Full Operational Capability): Develop a transition \nplan to ensure MCPO reaches full staffing and operational \nindependence.\n3.B.2. Update policies and procedures for bulk fuel management to \nalign with this organizational change and disseminate updates to \nstakeholders.\n3.B.3. Standardize training for fuel management personnel to ensure \nlong-term sustainability and effectiveness.\n3.B.4. Further implementation guidance for MCPO/SCP is available at \nhttps:(slash)(slash)usmc.sharepoint-mil.us.mcas.gov.us(slash) sites\n(slash)mcicom_g4_ss(slash)FIM(slash)SitePages(slash)MPCO\n3.C. Tasks. The MCPO/SCP will:\n3.C.1. Serve as the centralized authority for bulk fuel and fuel \ninfrastructure management, including policy development and \noperational guidance.\n3.C.2. Align Marine Corps fuel operations with DOD Joint Force \nstandards by coordinating with DOD entities such as the Defense \nLogistics Agency (DLA).\n3.C.3.

Delay of Promotion\n4.a.  Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (g), if the\nrespective commanding officer determines that an officer is not\nmentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for\npromotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the\nphysical examination requirement for reserve officers per section\n10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the\nofficer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the\nappointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the\nnotice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers\nmust also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the\nappointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps\nTotal Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of\nadministrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain\nguidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.\n4.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this\npromotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or\npotentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)\nremoved the names of those officers with records identified during\nthe adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially\nadverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN.  Those\nofficers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC\n(JPL).\n5.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary\nretirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to\nacceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion\ncarries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with\naugmentation into the regular component.\n6.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve\nofficer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have\naccepted such promotion on the effective date contained in\nparagraphs 2 and 3 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and\nallowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion,\nan officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC\n(MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their\npromotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the\nnext higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which\nsignals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their\nright to decline.\n7.  For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-1585 or\nDSN 278-1585.  Email inquiries may be submitted via the Officer\nPromotions homepage at www.Manpower.Marines.mil.  Email address is\nofficerpromotions@usmc.mil.\n8.  Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower\nManagement Division.//"

Meeting the character\ncount in iAPS does not justify exceeding the line count for the \ncitation, nor does meeting the line count justify exceeding the \ncharacter count.  \n4.b.2.  Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and Below.  To\ncomply with reference (g), the character limit for the Navy and \nMarine Corps Commendation Medal and the Navy and Marine Corps\nAchievement Medal iAPS citations/certificates will remain at 1250\ncharacters, typed in all capital letters.  Commands are authorized \nto deviate from the formatting requirements in reference (g) as\nidentified below:\n4.b.2.a.  The font size must be between 8 and 12 pitch.\n4.b.2.b.  The left and right margins must be between 0.5\u201d and 1.0.\u201d\n5.  Timeline for Submission.  Reference (g) states PMD nominations\nshould be submitted to the final awarding authority for\nadjudication at least 60 days prior to the desired presentation\ndate.  Failure to meet this timeline may result in the PMD not being \nadjudicated in time for the intended presentation.  The intent is \nfor approved PMDs to be presented to the recipient prior to \ndetachment or separation from the command in which the actions \noccurred.  Award originators must plan the submission timeline\nbased on the 60-day requirement.\n5.a.  In accordance with reference (h), awards approved by CMC, the\nnominations must reach CMC (MMPB-31) in iAPS NLT 60 days prior to \nthe anticipated presentation date.\n5.b.  In accordance with references (g) and (h), awards approved by\nthe SECNAV must reach CMC (MMPB-31) in iAPS NLT 90 days prior to the\nanticipated presentation date.\n6.  Requests to expedite PMDs awarded by CMC or higher authority.\nRequests to expedite PMDs will only be accepted in cases of \nretirement, relief and appointments, or changes of command.  \nA request to expedite an award must be signed by the senior \nendorsing General Officer.  A request to expedite an award reduces \nthe number of votes required by the HQMC Military Awards Board.  \nThis does not, however, guarantee that the award will be completed \nby the desired presentation date.  The request must include an \nexplanation of why the award needs to be expedited.\n7.  Retirement and Separation Awards.\n7.a.  Meritorious Period End Date. Please note that the end date for\nthe meritorious period of separation or retirement awards should be\napproximately two weeks prior to the retirement date or start\nof terminal leave.  This ensures that the award can be reported in\nMarine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and added to the Certificate\nof Release or Discharge (DD-214).  Awards not reported in MCTFS \nprior to a Marine starting terminal leave, or retirement are \ntypically not included on the DD-214.  In such cases, the Marine\nmust submit a request for correction to their DD-214 using Standard \nForm 180.\n7.b.  Other Service Originators.  Those Marines who are retiring \nfrom a joint command may be nominated for a DoN award.  The joint\ncommand should utilize the NAVMC 11533.  A blank copy of the NAVMC \n11533 can be found on the MMPB-31 website.  Once the NAVMC 11533 has\nbeen endorsed by the first General or Flag Officer in the joint \nchain of command, it should be submitted to the MMPB-3 \norganizational mailbox.\n8.  Certificates of Commendation and Below.  Although a SOA section\nexists in iAPS for Certificates of Commendation, a SOA is not \nrequired.  Simply enter \u201cSOA not required\u201d in this field.  Note that\nMeritorious Masts recommendations created in iAPS, are often\nerroneously forwarded to MMPB-31.  To prevent an unsigned document\nfrom being uploaded to the OMPF, it is recommended that the award be\noriginated by the awarding authority and that a signed certificate \nbe uploaded prior to approval.\n9.  Combat Action Ribbon (CR) and Combat Conditions PMDs.  It is\npossible to receive a PMD with a C device or a Bronze Star Medal for\nmeritorious service under combat conditions, and not qualify for the\nCR.  The awarding authority is responsible for ensuring the criteria\ncontained in reference (g) are met for all CR or a combat condition\naward recommendations.\n10.  Common Mistakes regarding PMDs.\n10.a.  Incorrect opening or closing sentences.  Specifically, on the\nNavy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and Navy and Marine Corps\nAchievement Medal.  Utilize Reference (g).\n10.b.  Inconsistent action dates on the NAVMC 11533 award form, SOA,\ncitation, and certificate.\n10.c.  Incorrect Meritorious Period End Date for Marines separating \nfrom service.  Specifically setting the date too late to allow for\nsufficient time for processing.\n10.d.  Inconsistent dates for award approval in iAPS and date on\ncertificate, see reference (g).\n10.e.  Incorrect use of \u201cgreat credit\u201d.  \u201cGreat credit\u201d is only used\non awards of the Air Medal and above.\n10.f.  A commander approving an award for which they are not the\nawarding authority.\n10.g.  A commander directing an originator to rescind an\naward and originate a lesser award.  Per reference (g), an award\nnomination may only be downgraded or disapproved by the official who\nhas the authority to approve the award.\n10.h.  Award approved in iAPS does not match the citation and\ncertificate presented to the recipient.\n10.i.  A Marine commander approving a DoN PMD for a foreign service\nmember.\n10.j.  Attaching documents other than the signed citation or\ncertificate in the \"certificate\" field in iAPS.  The documents\nattached in the certificate section of the approved award are\nuploaded into the recipient\u2019s OMPF.  Do not attach letters of \ntransmittal or the NAVMC 11533.\n10.k.  Administrative Corrections should be submitted to MMPB-31\nutilizing the template for administrative change requests on the\nMMPB-31 website.\n11.  This MARADMIN is applicable to the total force.\n12.  Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director,\nManpower Management Division.//"

Per refs (b) and (h), if the\nrespective commanding officer determines that an officer is not\nmentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for\npromotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the\nphysical examination requirement for reserve officers per section\n10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the\nofficer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the\nappointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the\nnotice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers\nmust also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the\nappointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps\nTotal Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of\nadministrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain \nguidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.\n6.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this\npromotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or\npotentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)\nremoved the names of those officers with records identified during\nthe adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially\nadverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those\nofficers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC\n(JPL).\n7.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary\nretirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to\nacceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion\ncarries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with\naugmentation into the regular component.\n8.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve\nofficer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have\naccepted such promotion on the effective date contained in\nparagraphs 2 through 5 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and\nallowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion,\nan officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC\n(MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their\npromotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the\nnext higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which\nsignals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their\nright to decline.\n9.  The following FY24 promotions are projected for April 2025 and\nare subject to change.  Promotions from the remaining FY24 boards\nwill be promulgated based on vacancy determination and senate\nconfirmation.\n            Senior Officer        Sel    Junior Officer        Sel\nCWO3\nMOS: 6604   M.

This message is a collaborative effort between\nDeputy Commandants (DC) for Programs & Resources (P&R) and\nInstallations & Logistics (I&L) addressing the role of the IOs in the\nproper execution of CUECs 1, 2, 3, 9, hereby referred to as access\nmanagement controls. IOs are command-appointed individuals \nresponsible for managing system access. The Marine Corps must appoint\nand train IOs at every level to effectively implement access\nmanagement controls in accordance with reference (a) and resolve the\nFinancial Information Systems Access Controls/Segregation of Duties\nmaterial weakness identified in reference (b). \n2.  Effectively immediately, all CGs, DCs, Commanders, and Directors\nat levels 1-4 in DAI must appoint sufficient IOs to: \n2.a.  CUEC 1: Ensure users complete annual cyber security awareness\ntraining and upload the training certificate in the Access Request \nManagement System (ARMS). \n2.b.  CUEC 2: Ensure users complete all access provisioning\nrequirements and that DAI access is terminated timely.\n2.c.  CUEC 3: Perform an annual DAI User Access Review (UAR).\n2.d.  CUEC 9: Resolve all identified segregation of duties (SOD)\nconflicts monthly.\n3.  Commands must identify a minimum of two IOs for each of these\nfunctional areas: Financial Management (FM), All Other Government,\nand Oracle Time and Labor (OTL). Some commands will need to appoint\nmore than two IOs in each of these functional areas due to their high\nnumber of DAI users. Likewise, commands may nominate the same\nindividual to be the IO for multiple functional areas with HQMC\napproval. \n4.  The typical IO distribution follows this structure: FM IOs reside\nwithin the Comptroller Section. All Other Government IOs reside\nwithin the Supply Section.  All Other Government includes all \npersonnel within the command involved in requisition operations.\nCommands have the discretion to appoint OTL IOs in either the \nPersonnel/Manpower Section or Comptroller Section, depending on where\npayroll operations reside.\n5.  IO Appointment Process\n5.a.  Users must obtain and complete the IO Appointment Letter Memo\ntemplate located at \nhttps:(slash)(slash)tso-confluence.mcw.usmc.mil/display/dkb/\ndai+arms+access+request\n5.b.  The appointment letter must be signed by CGs, DCs, Commanders,\nDirectors, or other designated officials authorized to sign by\ndirection.\n5.c.  Users must upload the signed appointment letter and submit a\nnew IO System Authorization Access Request (SAAR) in ARMS.\n5.d.  The P&R User Management (UMX) Section will review the required\ndocumentation and approve the IO SAARs appropriately. \n6.  L2 Commands must validate level 2-4 IOs with the P&R Systems and\nData Integration (SDI) Division and the I&L Logistics Compliance\nBranch (LPC) every quarter to ensure that the organization can\nsupport DAI access management controls. \n7.  The minimum number of IOs is a requirement eligible for\ninspections.\n8.  Assistance for IOs requesting responsibilities in DAI can be\nlocated at  https:(slash)(slash)tso-confluence.mcw.usmc.mil/display\n/dkb/dai+arms+access+request.  Choose the following files: Step-by-\nstep instructions for USMC DAI ARMS IO Access Request Guide.\n9.  The SDI Division and LPC Branch will coordinate training for IOs\nusing the Microsoft Teams platform.  A training schedule will be sent\nvia SEPCOR.

This message updates reference (a) and is a\ncollaborative effort between Deputy Commandants (DC) for Programs\n& Resources (P&R) and Installations & Logistics (I&L) with the\npurpose of enhancing the implementation of DAI CUEC 9, hereby\nreferred to as SOD controls.  To manage risk effectively, comply with\ncontrol standards, and achieve its financial statement audit goals,\nthe Marine Corps must ensure that users with DAI access only have the\nnecessary permissions required to perform their job functions.\n2.  Effectively immediately, all commands at levels 1-4 in DAI must\nresolve all identified SOD conflicts by either removing conflicting\nresponsibilities from users or obtaining waivers from the designated\nauthority.  \n3.  As part of continuing actions, Commands will be required to\nsupport requests for information arising from the monthly review of\nSOD reports (Application Access Controls Governor and the\nTransactions Controls Governor reports).  As part of this review, the\nP&R Systems and Data Integration (SDI) Division and the I&L Logistics\nCompliance Branch (LPC) will coordinate with applicable Commands to\nremediate identified SOD incidents.\n4.  Removing Conflicts.  L1-L4 Commands must assess users\u2019 current\nDAI responsibilities and compare them to job requirements. Any\nidentified conflict or unnecessary responsibilities must be removed\nby coordinating with the P&R User Management (UMX) Section. \n5.  Waivers.  Some commands lack the personnel to distribute\n responsibilities between users per SOD requirements.  Therefore, the\n Marine Corps has a waiver process to balance operational needs\nagainst compliance with control standards.\n6.  The SDI Division and the LPC Branch identified and reviewed\napplicable SOD conflicts.  They ranked each conflict using a\ncomprehensive review that assessed four risk criteria (fraud, audit,\noperations, and personable identifiable information). The analysis\nresulted in the following five risk categories and waiver paths:\n6.a.  Minimal risk conflicts will be adjudicated via an\nenterprise-wide waiver, and thus Commands are not required to address\nthem.\n6.b.  Low risk conflicts will be adjudicated via waivers signed by\nthe first General Officer in the chain of command.\n6.c.  Medium risk conflicts will be adjudicated via HQMC waivers. The\nSDI Director will adjudicate waivers for Financial Management (FM)\nand Oracle and Time Labor (OTL) personnel. The LPC Branch Head will\nadjudicate waivers for Other Government personnel. \n6.d.  High risk conflicts will be adjudicated via HQMC waivers. The\nAssistant Deputy Commandant P&R (Resources) will adjudicate waivers\nfor FM and OTL personnel.  The Assistant Deputy Commandant I&L\nLogistics Division will adjudicate waivers for Other Government\npersonnel.\n6.e.  Waivers will not be granted for zero-tolerance risk conflicts.\n7.  Waiver Instructions\n7.a.  The SOD matrix, the risk register, waiver templates, and\nadditional resources are available at https://usmc.sharepoint-mil.us\nsites/DCPR_SDI/Risk_Compliance/\n7.a.1.  The SOD matrix provides a summarized view of the identified\nrestricted role combinations.\n7.a.2.  The risk register provides a detailed view of SOD conflicts\nand the risk designation.\n7.a.3.  The waiver templates document the authorization for users to\nmaintain SOD conflicts. There is a waiver template for each\nidentified low, medium, and high-risk SOD conflict. \n7.b.  When users request a new responsibility through the access\nmanagement system (i.e., ARMS), the system will identify if the new\nresponsibility causes an SOD conflict, which requires a waiver to\nproceed.  Users must coordinate with their respective Command\nInformation Owners (IO) to initiate and submit waivers. \n7.c.  Command IOs must complete and submit to the designated\nauthority a waiver request for each SOD conflict identified.\n7.c.1.  For low-risk SOD conflict, Commands should leverage their\ninternal processes to submit and approve waivers.\n7.c.2.  For medium and high-risk SOD conflict, Command IOs must\nsubmit waivers using the Tier 1 Helpdesk JIRA process.\n7.d.  Users must upload the approved waiver to their profile in the\naccess management system.  The P&R UMX Section will validate the waivers. \n7.e.  If the request for a waiver is denied, the conflicting\nresponsibility will not be granted or if it had already been granted, it will be removed.\n8. When implementing the waivers, the following apply:\n8.a.  HQMC will evaluate and qualify the risk each SOD conflict poses\nto the enterprise annually and may result in conflicts being assigned\nto a different risk category.\n8.b.  Waivers are subject to periodic reviews to ensure their\ncontinued relevance and effectiveness. They may be revoked or\nmodified if it is determined that the risk level has changed or if\ncompliance issues are identified. \n8.c.  Waivers are not automatically granted and will be voided when\npersonnel are reassigned.\nThe Marine Corps reserves the right to remove user responsibilities\nas necessary.  All users must \nadhere to any mitigating controls established to minimize associated\nrisks. Regular reviews and audits will be conducted to ensure\ncompliance.  \n8.d.  All DAI users have a fiduciary responsibility inherent in their\nroles as stewards of government resources and must report SOD\nconflicts and responsibilities that are no longer required to their\nrespective IOs.\n9.  For specific questions, contact the following POCs:\n9.1.  FM personnel: Mr. Robert Burnand and Ms. Shajuana Nicholson.\n9.2.  All Other Government personnel: Ms. Sheila Warren.\n9.3.  OTL: Ms. Jessica Lynard-Kongkiat and Ms. Cheryl Dabrio.\n10.  This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force.\n11.  Release authorized by Anna N. K.

This message serves as interim\nguidance pending update to MCO 5430.1 regarding the certification\nprogram for personnel assigned to Inspector General (IG) billets\nacross the total force.\n2.  Background.\n2.a.  To preserve the Marine Corps\u2019 values, standards, and readiness\nas the Nation\u2019s expeditionary crisis response force, the Inspector \nGeneral of the Marine Corps (IGMC) introduced a campaign plan in\n2023 to enhance institutional readiness across the Service. A line\nof effort in this campaign plan focuses on the professionalization\nof the Marine Corps IG Enterprise.\n2.b.  The IGMC certification process is part of a deliberate \nstrategy to create an authoritative and standardized process to \nbuild and sustain a professional IG workforce in the Service.  The \nIGMC established the following framework that includes the required \nand tailored knowledge, skills, competencies, and abilities to \nachieve certification as a Marine Corps IG professional.  These \nrequirements apply to all uniformed and civilian IGMC personnel, \ncommand IG (CIG) personnel, and those serving in a Marine Corps IG \ncapacity that directly perform IG functions as described in REF A. \nCollectively, this group of personnel comprises the Service's IG \nEnterprise.\n3.  Execution.\n3.a.  Certification Process.\n3.a.1.  IGMC's certification process includes three required \nmilestones:\n3.a.1.a.  Milestone 1:  Foundational Training (an online IGMC 101 \nCourse provided on MarineNet as of 22 January 2025).\n3.a.1.b.  Milestone 2:  Advanced Training (IGMC-facilitated Mobile/\nVirtual Training Team (MTT/VTT)).\n3.a.1.c.  Milestone 3:  Six months of satisfactory service in an IG-\nrelated billet within IGMC or a CIG office.\n3.a.2.  IGMC 101 is an online course currently provided on MarineNet\n(Course ID: IGMC101). IGMC Advanced Training is provided biannually \nby IGMC personnel via an MTT or VTT.\n3.a.3.  The IGMC is the sole Certifying Authority (CA) and will only \naward certification to IG personnel after validating completion of \nall training requirements and milestones.\n3.a.4.  As the CA, the IGMC may revoke or suspend certification \nbased on unsatisfactory conduct or performance that is outside the \nethical behavior, integrity, and professionalism expected of those \nserving in the Marine Corps IG Enterprise.\n3.a.5.  New IG personnel should attend an MTT/VTT at the first \navailable opportunity, but not later than twelve months after being\nassigned or hired to an IG office.\n3.b.  Currency.  In order for IG personnel to maintain currency of \ntheir IGMC certification, they shall complete the training \nrequirements outlined below:\n3.b.1.  Annually, all IG personnel must receive at least one hour \nof ethics training led by an Ethics Counselor or through other IGMC-\napproved ethics training materials.  The Counsel to the IGMC is the \nprimary POC for determining other approved ethics training events.\n3.b.2.  Biennially, all IG personnel must attend one of the IGMC's \nAdvanced Training MTT/VTT events.\n3.c.  Training Management and Accountability.\n3.c.1.  Personnel training and certification management is the \nresponsibility of both the owning command and IGMC.  CIG offices and \nIGMC Divisions shall provide IGMC with starting dates of new \npersonnel, completion certificates for Foundational Training \n(Milestone 1), and facilitate enrollment and attendance of Advanced \nTraining (Milestone 2).  IG Enterprise personnel will upload \ninformation on to the IGMC sharepoint site:\n(https://usmc.sharepoint-mil.us/sites/igmc/tracker/SitePages/USMC-IG\n-Enterprise-Database.aspx).  IGMC will publish instructions\noutlining where and how to upload this information via separate\ncorrespondence.\n3.c.2.  IGMC will maintain rosters for Advanced Training events and \nrequest data calls on a biannual basis to determine the completion \nof six months of satisfactory performance (Milestone 3) of new IG \npersonnel.\n3.c.3.  CIG offices and IGMC Divisions shall record training \ncompletion by submitting an Electronic Personnel Administrative \nRequest (EPAR) within MOL to their servicing Installation Personnel \nAdministration Center (IPAC) to report via unit diary and record the \nassociated Service School Codes for IGMC 101 (0AV) and Advanced \nTraining courses (0AW) in the Marine Corps Total Force System for \nall uniformed IG personnel, and in the Total Workforce Management \nServices for civilian IG personnel.\n3.d.  Exception to Policy.\n3.d.1.  IGMC 101 is mandatory for all IG Enterprise personnel, \nregardless of time in billet or previous completed training.\n3.d.2.  IG Enterprise personnel who completed an MTT/VTT in CY23 or \nCY24 are exempt for two years from the date of training completion; \ntheir training counts for achieving certification Milestone 2.\n3.d.3.  The Service School Code for Advanced Training courses is \nactive as of 1 June 2023.  As such, IG personnel who completed an \nMTT/VTT in CY23, but prior to 1 June 2023, will list 1 June 2023 as \ntheir training completion date.\n4.  Coordinating instructions.\n4.a.  Continuous learning is essential to the sustainment of the \nMarine Corps IG Enterprise.  Personal ownership to seek\nopportunities to advance competencies and skills will benefit both\nthe individual and the Enterprise.  Owning commands should encourage\ntheir IG personnel to attend professional development opportunities.\nCommands are responsible for resourcing attendance of these\nopportunities. IGMC will facilitate professional development\nopportunities by advertising IG training events via IG Connections\n(https://www.igmc.marines.mil/Divisions/Connections/).\n4.b.  IGMC will assess unit compliance to this guidance during IGMC\ninspections.\n5.  This message applies to all uniformed and civilian IGMC \npersonnel, command IG personnel, and those serving in a Marine Corps \nIG capacity that directly perform IG functions as described in MCO \n5430.1.\n6.

This MARADMIN provides guidance on the \nissuance of the DD Form 214-1, which will complement the traditional \nDD Form 214, ensuring a more comprehensive record of service for \nMarines transitioning or separating from Reserve duty.\n2. Requirement. In accordance with reference (a), all Reserve \nComponent Marines separated or released from their component on \nor after the date of this MARADMIN shall receive a DD-214-1. \n3. Issuance of DD Form 214-1. The following Marines will be issued a \nDD Form 214-1 in conjunction with a DD Form 214:\n3.a. Marines separated or released from a Reserve Component.\n3.b. Reserve Component Marines transferred to the Individual Ready \nReserve.\n3.c. Reserve Component Marines transferred to the Standby Reserve or \nRetired Reserve.\n3.d. Recalled retirees reverting to a retired status.\n3.e. A complete list of qualifying circumstances for issuance are \nlocated in reference (a). \n4. Exemption. The DD Form 214-1 is not required to be issued for:\n4.a. Marines whose Reserve Component service is terminated by death.\n4.b. Instances where the issuance of the DD Form 214 is not \napplicable.\n5. Issuance Process. The DD Form 214-1, in conjunction with a DD \nForm 214, will be issued by the separation activity from which the \nMarine was separated and represents the standard record of service \nfor Marines of the Reserve Component. The DD Form 214-1 will never \nbe issued independently and will always be accompanied by the DD \nForm 214. In those instances where a DD Form 214/214-1 was not \nissued by the separation activity from which the Marine was \nseparated, corrective action must be taken by the separation \nactivity.\n6. Preparation. Because the DD Form 214/5 Series is an essential \nrecord of service, preparation requires that:\n6.a. Per reference (a), the DD 214-1, at the time of issuance, will\ncontain a concise summary of service.\n6.b. It is prepared accurately and completely and must be typed, or \ncomputer generated.\n6.c. The recipient will be informed that making any unauthorized \nchange or alteration of the form will render it void.\n6.d.  Abbreviations and acronyms should be avoided as much as \npossible.  \n6.e.  The DD Form 214-1 business processes are in reference (a) and\nwill be published to administrators via the Separation and \nRetirement Manual. Additional information is located on the MMSR \nwebsite at https:(slash)(slash)www.manpower.marines.mil/Manpower-\nManagement/Separation-and-Retirements-Branch/Inactive-Reserve-\nSeparation-and-Retirement/\n7.  This MARADMIN is applicable to the Total Force and will remain \nin effect until the revised Separation and Retirement Manual is \npublished.  \n8.

Purpose. To announce the Marine Corps Enlisted Career \nDesignation Program (ECDP) pilot for senior enlisted Marines.\n2.  Background \n2.a.  The Commandant's guidance on Talent Management directed a \nparadigm shift from our legacy high turnover \u201crecruit and replace\u201d\npersonnel model toward a greater emphasis on investment in and \nretention of our most capable Marines.  Currently, enlisted Marines\nmust submit retention requests at regular intervals that may not \nalign with their duty assignments or career aspirations.  This \nrequirement can create uncertainty for our most experienced and \nskilled Marines and their families as they await determination on\ntheir continued service, adding an unnecessary administrative burden\nto Marines, commanders, assignment monitors, and Career Counselors. \n2.b.  The implementation of an ECDP pilot allows Staff \nNon-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) in the grades of E-8 and E-9 to\nvoluntarily enter the ECDP upon their next reenlistment to serve to\ncurrent Enlisted Career Force Controls (ECFC). \n3.  Program Overview  \n3.a.  Eligibility. Effective 1 June 2025, Marines in the grades of\nE-8 and E-9 with an End of Current Contract (ECC) date before \n30 September 2026 and at least 15 years of service or over two years\ntime in grade will be eligible to submit their final reenlistment \npackage to the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC), Manpower \nManagement Enlisted Assignments (MMEA) to enter the ECDP.  Marines\nelecting not to enter ECDP will be required to submit for \nreenlistment upon future ECC dates to continue their service.  An\nadditional option will be made available for a Marine to enter into\nECDP at the time of the next reenlistment.  Marines must submit for\nreenlistment in accordance with reference (b).  \n3.b.  Incurred Obligated Service.  Initial reenlistment into ECDP \nincurs an additional 24-month service obligation starting at the end\nof their current contract.  Enlisted career designated Marines will\nincur additional service obligations for, but not limited to, \npromotion, assignment, Selective Retention Bonus (SRB) payment, and\nTransfer of Education Benefits as appropriate in accordance with \napplicable corresponding guidance.\n3.c. Assignments. Marines are required to obligate service in \naccordance with Joint Travel Regulations when executing a permanent\nchange of station or permanent change of assignment orders. Marines\nwho choose not to fulfill this obligation must submit a resignation\nas specified in reference (d) or request for retirement to Manpower\nManagement Enlisted Assignments (MMEA) and Manpower Management\nSeparations and Retirement (MMSR).\n4.  Separations\n4.a.  Retirement and Resignation. Individuals on the ECDP must \nrequest separation or retirement between 6 and 18 months of their \nPlanned Retirement/Resignation (PRR) date. The requested PRR date\nwill be no earlier than the date from which all obligations are\nsatisfactorily fulfilled. \n4.b.  ECDP Marines who desire to resign instead of complying with\nassignment instructions must request separation within 30 days of\nreceipt of orders.  Upon CMC (MMSR) approval, Marines who are \nretirement eligible will receive a PRR date no later than the last\nday of the month following the estimated arrival date to the new \nduty station.  Marines who are not retirement-eligible will receive\na reenlistment code (RE) of RE-3O with a separation date six months\nfrom the Marine\u2019s RE-3O acknowledgement.  \n5.  Selective Retention Bonus Program \n5.a.  Marines entering career designation and those already career\ndesignated may be eligible for an SRB based on military occupational\nspecialty (MOS) requirements.  To receive an SRB once in the ECDP,\nthe Marine must complete a statement of understanding in \ncoordination with the Marine\u2019s Career Counselor.\n5.b.  Marines receiving an SRB must commit to the requisite \nadditional service outlined in the SRB MARADMIN.  This obligation\ndoes not run concurrently with their initial entry into ECDP.\n6.  Reduction in Rank \n6.a.  Marines serving on the ECDP who are reduced in grade may\nexceed the applicable retention control point.  If a Marine\u2019s\nreduction in rank exceeds their ECFC for that grade, the Marine\nwill subsequently have an expiration of active service (EAS)\nmodified not earlier than 4 months or later than 6 months after\nthe effective date of the reduction in rank or removal of select\ngrade as determined by CMC (MM). \n6.b.  Marines between 18 and 20 years of active service will be\npermitted to retire on the last day of the month following the month\nthey reach 20 years of active service, unless administratively\nseparated in accordance with reference (d). \n6.c.  Marines with at least 20 of years active service who exceed \nthe service limitation for their current rank because of a reduction\nin rank or revocation of promotion selection must retire within \n6 months after the effective date of the reduction in grade or \nrevocation of promotion selection.\n6.d.  Marines can be involuntarily removed from the ECDP through\nadministrative separation in accordance with reference (d). Career \nMarines who enter the ECDP will still be required to maintain all \nMarine Corps standards in accordance with applicable orders.\n7.  Administration \n7.a.  The establishment of the ECDP and the above policy and \nprocedure refinements will be codified into all relevant Marine \nCorps Orders as they are revised. \n7.b.  Service-wide education of the ECDP will be provided to all\ngeneral officer-level commands, Installation Personnel \nAdministrative Centers, Enlisted Staff Academy, and the CMC\u2019s\nCornerstone Commander\u2019s course. \n7.c.  A Marine entering the ECDP will have their final opportunity\nto sell back lump sum leave in conjunction with their reenlistment,\nper reference (b).  Once in ECDP, Marines are unable to sell back \nleave unless they are executing separation or retirement. \n8.  This MARADMIN is not applicable to the Marine Corps Reserve.\n9.

These include, but are not \nlimited to, appropriate implementation of file access controls for \nfiles containing PII and implementation of access and audit controls \nfor PHI.  Failure to apply necessary controls may result in \nunplanned or unannounced removal of files from the network. \n3.b.  The program executive officer for digital and the supporting \ninformation system security manager for the M365 suite on the \nMCEN-N/Unclassified network will submit updated authorization \ndocumentation which includes the power platform suite of \ncapabilities with associated cybersecurity controls, to the Marine \nCorps authorizing official for review, assessment, and certification \nno later than 31 May 2025. \n3.c.

Background.  Per reference (a), DHMRSi is the authoritative data\nsystem for military medical personnel labor allocation and must be\nused for documenting and reporting labor within a MTF or DTF.  \nDMHRSi is essential to provide a timely and complete picture of the\nsupport rendered by the Marine Corps to the Military Health System\n(MHS), as outlined in references (a) through (d). Secondarily, it\nprovides data relevant to tracking readiness and predictability of\nclinical support to the MTF/DTF.\n3.  Execution.\n3.a.  Per reference (a), all BSO-27 health services support (HSS)\npersonnel involved in direct clinical care or clinical support at an\nMTF/DTF shall have an active DMHRSi account.

Per reference (a), the Commanding General,\nTraining and Education Command serves as the sponsor for the Marine\nCorps Combat Marksmanship Program (MCCMP).  Commanding General,\nTraining Command staffs and distributes products developed by MCCMP\nProponent.  The Commanding Officer, Weapons Training Battalion (WTBn)\nQuantico, serves as the Marksmanship Proponent.  The Director of the\nMarksmanship Program Management Section (MPMS), WTBn Quantico, serves\nas the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for items in the MCCMP\norder.  MPMS develops, maintains, and updates all master lesson files\nand other supporting documentation for conducting marksmanship\ntraining throughout the Marine Corps.  MPMS has direct liaison\nauthority with other commands where necessary and appropriate to\naccomplish these efforts. \n2.  WTBn Quantico hosted the FY25  Combat Marksmanship Symposium\n(CMS) from 16-18 October 2024.  The CMS provides a single forum for\nkey leaders from across the Total Force to consider combat\nmarksmanship issues and subsequently provide senior leadership an\naccurate picture of the Service\u2019s current marksmanship state along\nwith recommendations for the future.  Reference (e) is the Marine\nCorps Marksmanship Campaign Plan (MCP), which was signed on\n16 September 2024, and charged the Force to realize a quantitative\nincrease in individual Marine and unit lethality to meet the demands\nof the future operating environment.  The FY25 CMS was conducted with\nthe explicit focus on realizing the MCP vision in its entirety.\nPost-CMS, TECOM\u2019s Marksmanship Working Group (MWG) will ensure the\nMCP\u2019s specified tasks are completed as directed.\n3.  The FY25 CMS included the following working groups (WG):\nEntry-Level Qualification (ELQ), the Marksmanship Instructor Training\nContinuum, Joint Marksmanship Assessment Package (JMAP) Fielding,\nPrecision Marksman and Advanced Precision Marksman Way Forward, and\nInfantry Marksmanship Assessment standardization at the Schools of\nInfantry (SOI). \n4.  At the CMS\u2019s conclusion, the following items were brought forward\nfor MCCMP sponsor and proponent review and decision, and all were\napproved: \n4.a.  The ELQ WG developed the plan to achieve MCP task IO 1.1.1\nand 3.3.2.  IO 1.1.1 directs the development of a training program to\nprogress a Marine from having never fired a weapon to qualifying with\nan Annual Rifle Qualification (ARQ)-like evaluation and ultimately\nwith a complete ARQ evaluation by FY29.  IO 3.3.2 directs a\nproof-of-concept test on recruit populations firing the ARQ and\nbuilding on the success of ongoing entry-level officer ARQ\nimplementation.\n4.b.  Marksmanship Instructor Training Continuum.  To reduce\nredundancy and increase efficiency between four different\nmarksmanship courses, WTBN-Quantico will conduct a proof-of-concept\ncourse beginning in third quarter FY25.  This proof-of-concept will\nconsolidate the associated tasks between the existing courses and\nincrease instructor capacity.  Instructor development will account\nfor planned fielding of JMAP IAW reference (e). Further discussion\nwill be conducted at the FY26 CMS.\n4.c.  Precision Marksmanship.  The CMS included extensive discussions\nfocused on the intent to have one precision marksman (PM) per rifle\nsquad in each infantry battalion along with the future Advanced PM\nleadership billet tasked in Ref (e).  Both items will be the focus\nof a Total Force Operational Planning Team (OPT) to be conducted in\nJanuary 2025, with further OPT details released SEPCOR.  \n4.d.  SOI Standards for the Infantry Marksmanship Assessment (IMA)\nand Rifleman Marksmanship Assessment (RMA).  \n4.d.1.  WTBN-Quantico IMA and RMA guidelines to the SOIs via\nseparate correspondence coinciding with this message.  The guidelines\nwill include event setup, execution, and administrative instructions\nto ensure standardized execution of the events. The standards or\nminimum scores required for each stage of the IMA and RMA are\neffective with this message and will be re-assessed on 1 April 2025.\n4.d.2.  The zero stage of the IMA and RMA was not previously\nrecorded with sufficient data points to establish a clear minimum\nstandard.  IAW the revised guidelines, the zero stage will be\nrecorded to collect data without a minimum requirement, which will\nallow for a revised standard to be implemented on 1 April 2025.\n5.  The CMS met its intent to gain a clear picture of the current\nstate of Marine Corps marksmanship and the next steps required to\nachieve the MCP vision.  WTBN-Quantico shall draft a calling message\nfor the FY26 CMS in May 2025 announcing the symposium dates,\nanticipated topics based on the MCP, and to solicit further inputs\nfrom the Total Force.  \n6.  Contact the POCs for any requests for information.\n7.  Release authorized by Lieutenant General Benjamin T. Watson,\nCommanding General, Training and Education Command.//"

This message solicits applications to fill FY26 \nand FY27 SCO billet vacancies.  All applicants must be prepared to \nmove in the early summer of FY26, if selected.  The International \nAffairs Program (IAP) seeks qualified officers to serve in Joint SCO\nbillets with respective Combatant Commands (CCMD).  The board will \nselect officers based on their specific political-military and \nsecurity cooperation experience, language, regional expertise, and \ncultural (LREC) skills, and performance as Marine Air Ground Task \nForce officers.  Per ref (b), SCOs serve in influential \nstrategic-level positions where they are the foremost points of \ncontact between the Department of Defense and the host nation \nMinistry of Defense, other government agencies, small businesses, \nand academia.  SCOs are located in or associated with U.S. \ndiplomatic facilities worldwide and are responsible for overseeing \nand implementing in-country security cooperation events, to include\nsecurity assistance programs, and for facilitating cooperation in \nresearch, development, and acquisition with allied and partner \nnations.\n1.a.  Major timeline milestones are (read in two columns):\nDate                        Milestone                         \n18 April 2025               Applications due                     \n5 May 2025                  Board convenes\n2 June 2025                 Release of results\n2.  Eligibility\n2.a.  Eligibility requirements\n2.a.1.  Applicants must be on active duty.\n2.a.2.  Must receive monitor concurrence.\n2.a.3.  Time on station requirements. \n2.a.4.  Applicants must meet minimum prescribed tour control factor\n(TCF) and be eligible for permanent change of station (PCS) orders \nin FY26.  All FY27 SCO billets require language training in FY26 \nunless a selectee already possess the required language skills.  \nThose selected for FY26 SCO billets will move in FY26 and not attend\nlanguage training.\n2.a.4.a.  If an applicant does not meet their prescribed TCF \nrequirements in paragraph 2.a.4, they must submit a exception to \npolicy (ETP), endorsed by the first O-6 in the chain of command, via\nNAVMC 10274 (AA-Form), with their application.  Transfer inside of \nthe prescribed TCF will result in a gap for that command until the \nTCF has concluded.  If an officer is selected prior to his/her \nnormal rotation date, Manpower Management Officer Assignments (MMOA)\nwill attempt to provide a backfill.  A commander's endorsement of \nthe AA Form is considered acknowledgement of this situation.  MMOA\nwill adjudicate the ETP separately from the board process and must \nbe approved by MMOA before a Marine will be considered for a SCO\nbillet vacancy.

COLON/GS11/RAM/TEL: (703) 432-9590/E-MAIL: \nRAM-1(AT)USMC. MIL//\nGENTEXT/REMARKS/\n1.  Purpose.  This MARADMIN provides a consolidated source of \ninformation and guidance for officers transitioning from the Active \nComponent (AC) to the Reserve Component (RC).  Additionally, it \nprovides amplifying guidance for the creation and processing of the \nNAVMC 763.\n2.  Background.  In accordance with reference (a), the President \nshall have the power to appoint officers of the United States.  \nReference (b) delegates the appointment of armed forces officers to \nthe Secretary of Defense.  References (c) and (d) state that officers\non the Active-Duty List (ADL) will have a Regular appointment and all \nofficers on the Reserve Active-Status List (RASL) will have a Reserve\nappointment.  The ADL contains all AC officers and the RASL contains \nall RC officers.  Reserve appointments for officers transitioning \nfrom the AC to the RC require a minimum of four months from the date \nreceived at Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) for approval.  In cases \nwhere the officer was subject to adversity this timeline is increased.\n3.  Process\n3.a.  Transferring after initial obligation\n3.a.1.  Regardless of commissioning source, an AC officer\u2019s initial \ncontract in the Marine Corps is for a period of eight years.  The \nfirst portion of the eight-year obligation is typically performed in \nthe AC.  If an officer separates from the AC before their military \nservice obligation of eight-years is completed, they will be \ntransferred to the RC to complete the required service obligation in \naccordance with reference (e).  An officer can view their end of \nobligated service (EOS) date within their Basic Individual Record \nwithin the Marine Online website.  CMC(RA) will identify and submit \nqualified officers for a Reserve commission via the Secretary of \nDefense.\n3.a.2.  Officers who have prior enlisted service may be beyond their \nEOS date upon end of active service (EAS) during their initial AC \nofficer contract.  If an officer in this scenario separates at their \nEAS and desires to transfer to the RC, they must ensure their \nseparations code in block 26 of their DD-214 indicates this intent.  \nCMC(RA) will identify and submit such officers for a Reserve \ncommission via the Secretary of Defense automatically.  No further \naction is required on behalf of the officer.\n3.b.  Transferring after career designation\n3.b.1.  Officers who have accepted career designation, completed all \nAC obligations, and desire to transfer to the RC must request to \nresign their AC commission in accordance with chapter five of \nreference (e).  Once the resignation has been approved and an EAS is\npopulated in the resigning officer\u2019s record, CMC(RA) will submit for\na Reserve commission via the Secretary of Defense.  \n3.b.2.  AC officers who submit for consideration on an Active Reserve\nAccession Board will be submitted for a Reserve commission by CMC(RA). \n3.b.3.  Officers with special circumstances who request to separate \nfrom the AC and transfer to the RC inside of the four-month window, \noutlined in reference (g), must immediately notify the Reserve \nAffairs Officer Appointment Manager via RAM-1(at)usmc.mil to \ndetermine if the request is viable.\n4.  Notification\n4.a.  RA does not directly notify individual officers who are \napproved for a Reserve commission.  Approval is reflected in the \nplanned separations code within Marine Corps Total Force System \n(MCTFS).\n4.b.  RA will notify any officer who requested to transition to the \nRC but is deemed ineligible due to substantiated adversity in \naccordance with reference (g).\n5.  Acceptance of a Reserve Commission  \n5.a.  Per reference (h), the acceptance of a Reserve commission is \ndocumented on an Appointment Acceptance and Record (NAVMC 763).  It \nis the single proof source legal document maintained within an \nofficer\u2019s Official Military Personnel File (OMPF).  The NAVMC 763 \nserves as evidence of the legal basis by which both commissioned and \nwarrant officers discharge their sworn duties and provides the \nfoundation for validating an officer's retirement eligibility and \nentitlements.\n5.b.  Unit administration or the section handling the records of a \nseparating officer must produce an updated NAVMC 763 correlating to \nofficers\u2019 MCTFS record.  This updated NAVMC 763 must be issued to the\nseparating officer before their separation takes place.  The \nseparating officer is responsible for obtaining a signature from an \nAdministering Officer who is higher in grade than the separating \nofficer.  After obtaining the signature, the officer must return the \ncompleted NAVMC 763 to the issuing section.  The issuing section must \nupload the completed NAVMC 763 to the officer\u2019s Official Military \nPersonnel File (OMPF).  The IPAC will be responsible for ensuring the \nDD-214, NAVMC 763, and all records related to the officer\u2019s \nseparation are accurately updated and stored in their OMPF. If an \nIPAC is unavailable, the reporting unit will take responsibility for \nupdating and properly storing the DD-214, NAVMC 763, and all \nseparation-related records in the officer\u2019s OMPF.\n5.c.  Approval for a Reserve commission is reflected within the \nplanned separation code within MCTFS.\n5.d.  Guidance on how to properly complete the NAVMC 763 for officers \ntransferring from the AC to the RC is as follows:\n5.d.1.  Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5a, 5b, 6, 7, 9, 9a, 10, 11, 13, 14, \n14a, 15, 15a, and 17 shall coincide with the officer's current status \nand current data within MCTFS using Marine Corps database codes in \nthe manpower codes lookup guide at https: (slash)(slash) \nwww2.manpower.usmc.mil/lookups/lookups/lookups.action.  Note all item \ndates shall be in the following format (MM DD YYYY).\n5.d.2.  Items 8, 8a, 8b, 12, 12a, 16, and 16a will be \"N/A\".\n5.d.3.  Items 18 and 18a are the component and code the officer is \ntransferring to (\"USMCR\" for 18 and \"K7\" for 18a). \n5.d.4.  Item 19 is \"N\" (not assigned immediately to active duty). \n5.d.5.  Item 20 is \"8A\" for transfer from the AC to the RC (EAS or \nresignation) or \"8I\" for Captains twice passed over for promotion.\n5.d.6.  Item 20a is \"12203\".\n5.d.7.  Item 20b is \"TRANSITIONAL\".  There is not a specific program \nfor this section when transferring from the AC to the RC. \nTransitional is appropriate.\n5.d.8.  Item 21 shall contain all prior service to include the end \ndate of the current component place in column (d) which must \ncorrespond with the date entered on block 12b from the individual's \nDD-214 release from active-duty date, prior to switching to the new \ncomponent listed in item 18.  \"(not creditable for pay purposes)\" \nshall be typed across the (a), (b), and (c) columns, above the \nrequired item information, for each component period of military \nservice that is not creditable for computation of basic pay in \naccordance with reference (f).  The \"EFF DATE\" below item 21 is the\nday that the component change is to take effect.  This should be the \nday after the officer's EAS, which shall be the day after last entry \nin column 21d and block 12b from the officer's DD-214.\n5.d.9.  Item 22 shall be signed by the applicable officer.  Fill in \nas \"subscribed and duly sworn to before me at (location) this (number \ndate) day of (month and year)\".  Example \"subscribed and duly sworn \nto before me at MCB Quantico, VA this 10th day of November 1775\".\n5.e.  Distribution of the completed NAVMC 763 is an essential part of\nthe officer's record and must be uploaded by the separating section \ninto the officers OMPF by visiting https:(slash)(slash) \nwww4.manpower.usmc.mil/orma/#/then you can access the Records \nManagement Application(O-RMA).\n6.  Training.  Instructional training can be found at https:(slash)\n(slash) www.marinenet.usmc.mil/mvs/v.aspx?Id=6350B3B28CE6\n7.  Command and Signal.  The point of contact for Reserve commission\n questions can be directed to RAM-1(at)usmc.mil.\n8.  This MARADMIN cancels MARADMIN\u2019s 356/12, 356/12 and 369/17.\n9.

The purpose of the strategist program is to select up\nto two officers to fill Marine Corps requirements for doctorates\nwith a focus on strategic affairs.  This track is designed for\ncandidates to complete coursework within two academic years and a\ndissertation within one academic year.  Traditionally, officers\nhave been encouraged to attend universities in the NCR, however\nmany officers have been accepted and successfully completed PHD\nprograms at top-tier institutions outside of the NCR.

On 26 August 2024, the Director for Manpower \nManagement convened the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Marine Active and\nReserve Attach\u00e9 (MARA) Selection Board to select Marines as primary \ncandidates and identify alternates for duty with the Defense \nAttach\u00e9 Service (DAS) to report in FY26.  The Secretary of Navy\nhas approved the list of Marines herein and nominated them to the \nDefense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for final approval by the \nSecretary of Defense.\n2.  The board considered the packages of 46 qualified applicants and \nselected 13 officers as primary candidates.  Demonstrated \nperformance, Marine Air Ground Task Force experience, and the \npotential to operate effectively in a foreign, independent duty \nenvironment were among the factors considered in the selection \nprocess.\n3. This MARADMIN specifically releases the Senior Defense Official/\nDefense Attach\u00e9 (SDO/DATT) primary selected candidates.  Ref (d)\npreviously released all Non-SDO/DATT primary selected candidates. \n4.  Board results\n4.a.  Primary selections.  Any changes from the originally \nadvertised country list were based on requirements from DIA.  \n4.a.1.  The board selected the following active duty officers for \nnomination to the DAS as SDO/DATTs with their slated assignments:\nName                       MOS     Country           \nJohnson, Reese H.          0102    Dominican Republic\nPettibon, Jonathon E.      0202    Papua New Guinea\nZastoupil, Frank C.        7518    Ghana\n5.  Coordinating instructions\n5.a.  Primary selectees\n5.a.1.  Active duty acceptance of selection.  Selectees shall accept \nor decline via email to their PMOS monitor no later than 31 January \n2025.  Selectees will copy their acceptance email to the HQMC Marine \nAttach\u00e9 Program Office at mara_application@usmc.mil to communicate \nacceptance of assignment and receive further guidance. \n5.b.  Alternate selectees.  All alternates were identified in ref \n(d).  No action is required on the part of Marines on the alternate \nlist.  In the event that a billet becomes vacant, Manpower \nManagement will fleet-up an officer from the alternate list.  PMOS \nmonitors will directly contact any alternate selected as a fleet-up.\n5.c.  Declinations and deferrals  \n5.c.1  Declinations.  Marines who decline assignment to a MARA \nbillet must submit a declination in writing (AA form) via the first \nO6 in their chain of command addressed to HQMC via MMOA-3 NLT 31\nJanuary 2025.  Marines who decline will be ineligible for future \nMARA billets, unless otherwise approved by the Director, Manpower \nManagement.\n5.c.2.  Deferrals.  Marines selected for assignment to a MARA billet \nwho are unable to execute orders due to extraordinary circumstances \nmay request a deferral.  If approved, the Director, Manpower \nManagement will defer the Marine to a future MARA selection panel.  \nPrimary selectees may submit a deferral request in writing (AA Form)\nvia the first general officer in their chain of command addressed to \nHQMC via MMOA-3 NLT 31 January 2025.\n5.d.  Reporting and training\n5.d.1.  Selected Marines can expect Permanent Change of Station \norders for training in the National Capital Region.  Training start \ndates are dependent upon the assigned country and corresponding \ntraining requirements but can begin in Spring 2025.  Selected \nofficers with competing service requirements which could potentially\ndelay their availability for training must notify their primary MOS \nmonitor in their initial correspondence.\n5.d.2.  A limited portion of training during the Joint Military \nAttach\u00e9 School (JMAS) is available to the spouses of selected \nofficers.  Although spouse attendance is not required, it is highly \nrecommended and does not incur any additional cost to the service \nmember.  Language training is available to the spouse for most \nbillets at the request of the selected officer.  In addition to \ntraining, a security clearance will be submitted for the spouse.\n5.d.3.  Spouses must be naturalized U.S. citizens prior to the \nservice member attending JMAS.\n5.d.4.  Service members must complete a Counter Intelligence \nPolygraph examination prior to departing their current command.  \nThis will be coordinated through the selectee's parent command.\n6.

Per refs (b) and (g), if the\nrespective commanding officer determines that an officer is not\nmentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for\npromotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the\nphysical examination requirement for reserve officers per section\n10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the\nofficer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the\nappointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the\nnotice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers\nmust also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the\nappointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps\nTotal Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of\nadministrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain\nguidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.\n4.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this\npromotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or\npotentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)\nremoved the names of those officers with records identified during\nthe adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially\nadverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN.  Those\nofficers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC\n(JPL).\n5.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary\nretirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to\nacceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion\ncarries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with\naugmentation into the regular component.\n6.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve\nofficer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have\naccepted such promotion on the effective date contained in\nparagraphs 2 and 3 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and\nallowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion,\nan officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC\n(MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their\npromotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the\nnext higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which\nsignals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their\nright to decline.\n7.  For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-1585 or\nDSN 278-1585.  Email inquiries may be submitted via the Officer\nPromotions homepage at www.Marines.mil.  Email address is\nofficerpromotions@usmc.mil.\n8.  Release authorized by MajGen Ryan S. Rideout, Director, Manpower\nManagement Division.//"

Under the provisions of section 578 of ref (a) and ref (c), the\nSecretary of the Navy, acting for the President of the United\nStates, hereby authorizes the promotion of the following named\nregular officer(s) as indicated, to the permanent grade of Chief\nWarrant Officer Four (CWO4) and Chief Warrant Officer Three (CWO3).\nRank, pay, and allowances are effective from 1 February 2025.\nName                            Grade        MCC\nRyan M. Collins                 CWO4         J78\nVannik Keo                      CWO3         092\n6.  Delay of Promotion\n6.a.  Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (h), if the\nrespective commanding officer determines that an officer is not\nmentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for\npromotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the\nphysical examination requirement for reserve officers per section\n10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the\nofficer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the\nappointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the\nnotice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers\nmust also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the\nappointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps\nTotal Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of\nadministrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain \nguidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.\n6.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this\npromotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or\npotentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)\nremoved the names of those officers with records identified during\nthe adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially\nadverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those\nofficers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC\n(JPL).\n7.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary\nretirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to\nacceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion\ncarries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with\naugmentation into the regular component.\n8.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve\nofficer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have\naccepted such promotion on the effective date contained in\nparagraphs 2 through 5 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and\nallowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion,\nan officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC\n(MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their\npromotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the\nnext higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which\nsignals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their\nright to decline.\n9.  The following FY24 promotions are projected for March 2025 and\nare subject to change.  Promotions from the remaining FY24 boards\nwill be promulgated based on vacancy determination and senate\nconfirmation.\n            Senior Officer        Sel    Junior Officer        Sel\nCWO4\nMOS: 2120   list cleared                 list cleared\nCWO3\nMOS: 5804   none                  none   none                  none \n10.

Purpose. Effective as of 1 October 2024, this \nMARADMIN provides guidance to support Marine Corps Recruiting \nCommand\u2019s (MCRC) Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 accession mission. This \nMARADMIN updates reference (a) and announces the FY25 Enlistment \nOption Programs (EOP) and the Enlistment Bonus Program (EBP). It \nalso provides guidance for the FY25 Selected Marine Corps Reserve \n(SMCR) Enlistment Bonus (EB) and Montgomery G.I. Bill \u2013 Selected \nReserve (MGIB-SR) Kicker. The SMCR EB is authorized for either \n10,000 or 6,000 dollars. The MGIB-SR Kicker amount varies up to 350\ndollars a month for no more than 36 months.\n2. Background\n2a. The Marine Corps\u2019 objective is to maximize the number of fully\ntrained, qualified, experienced, and deployable Marines in the \nFleet Marine Force (FMF) over time and within any given personnel \nbudget. As we progress towards an \u201cinvest and retain\u201d model, it is\ncritical to channel applicants into the right occupational fields \nto maximize our return on investment and increase Marines\u2019 \npropensity to serve beyond their initial contract.\n2b. The Enlistment Incentive Program (EIP) provides recruiters with \ndifferent options of enlistment programs available to entry-level \napplicants. The EIP supports the recruiting effort in acquiring the\ntalent necessary to support the Force Design and FMF. These various\nprograms ensure qualified applicants are aligned to a program that\nbest fits their desires and talents.\n2c. This EIP plan establishes the Program Enlisted For (PEF) and \nvarious Bonus PEF (BPEF) options available for MCRC to meet the \nannual accession requirement for the active component.\n3. Active Component Enlistment Incentives\n3a. Enlistment Option Program. The EOP offers applicants specific \nskill-group guarantees via PEFs. A PEF groups Primary Military \nOccupational Specialties (PMOS) by prerequisites. Every active \ncomponent Marine Corps\u2019 applicant enlists within a PEF, not a \nspecific MOS. An applicant\u2019s Statement of Understanding (SOU) \noutlines the specific PEF enlistment requirements. The PEF and PMOS\ndistributions for FY25 are listed below.

The EBP will be continually refined to\nenable the Marine Corps to remain competitive in the war for talent. \nThe EBP facilitates the market expansion required to achieve annual \nshipping goals, skill channeling of talent into Force Design \npriorities, and to support service-level efforts to increase return \non personnel investment. Bonuses may be adjusted during the FY as \nrecruiting environment conditions require. The PEFs eligible for a \nbonus for FY25 are as follows:\nPEF           BPEF  Description                            Amount \n(1) BY        QY    Electronic Maintenance                 $15,000\n(2) DG        QQ    Cyber and Crypto Operations            $15,000\n(3) Any       QE    $5,000 Shipping Bonus                  $5,000\n(4) Any       QF    $10,000 Shipping Bonus                 $10,000\n(5) Targeted  QT    Targeted Investment Shipping Bonus     $9,000\n(6) Any       QV    Plus 1 Year Targeted Investment Bonus  $7,000\n(7) Any       QW    Plus 2 Years Targeted Investment Bonus $15,000\n4. Active Component Bonus Types\n4.a. Skill bonuses are those bonuses listed in paragraph 3b. that\nare associated to a PEF (e.g. QY PEF is associated with the BY \nPEF). Applicants with either a QY or BY will be classified into one\nof the PMOSs under the BY PEF (Electronics Maintenance) listed in \nparagraph 3a.\n4.b. Shipping bonuses are not associated with a particular PEF and\ncan be applied to any PEFs. Applicants given the shipping bonus (QE)\nwill first sign an SOU for a PEF listed in paragraph 3a.\n4.c. The Targeted Investment Shipping Bonus (QT) is reserved for an \napplicant aligned to a targeted list of PEFs denoted by (*) in \nparagraph 3a. Applicants given this bonus will agree to begin their \nobligated service timeline following the awarding of a PMOS. This \nenhanced monetary incentive supports ongoing service-level efforts \nto increase return on personnel investment.\n4.d. The Target Investment Plus 1/Plus 2 bonuses continue in FY25 to \naddress contract inefficiencies by providing longer contract \noptions. Targeted Investment Plus 1 (QV) and Targeted Investment \nPlus 2 (QW) bonuses require applicants to sign 1 or 2 additional \nyears of service to their term of enlistment (TOE) in their \ncontracts prior to shipping to recruit training. These bonuses will \nbe paid out upon the Join (TTC 020) to the School of Infantry (SOI) \nand will be recouped at a prorated amount if a Marine does not \ncomplete their full TOE.\n4.e. Active component applicants may receive only one enlistment \nbonus. \n5. The following guidance is in support of administrators\u2019 \nauthorization, obligation, and payment of active component \nenlistment bonuses. As outlined in reference (b), chapter 9, \nsection 91201, the auto-generated enlistment bonus obligation type \ntransaction code (TTC 245 000) and payment transactions \n(TTC 392 000) remain unchanged.\n5a. For the QY and QQ bonuses, the first permanent duty station Join\nwill automatically trigger (TTC 392 SEQ 000) and process the \nEnlistment Bonus (402 Remark). In the event the system generated \n(TTC 392 SEQ 000) transaction fails to process, the administrative \nReporting Unit Code (RUC)/Installation Personnel Administration \nCenter (IPAC) can report TTC 392 SEQ 000 in accordance with \nreference (b), chapter 9, and section 91201.\n5b. For the QE, QF, QV, and QW bonuses, once the Enlistment Bonus \nAuthorization (TTC 245 000) is reported and posted, the first SOI \nJoin (TTC 020) will automatically trigger (TTC 392 000) and process \nthe Enlistment Bonus (402 Remark). \n5c. For the QT bonus, payment (TTC 392) will be generated once the \nMarine\u2019s administrative RUC/IPAC reports TTC 116 for extension of \nenlistment equal to the number of months spent at Basic Training, \nSOI, and PMOS \u201cA\u201d and or \u201cC\u201d School (if \"C\" school is required for \nawarding of the PMOS).\n6. SMCR EB\n6.a. Amounts. The SMCR EB amount is 10,000 dollars for those \nenlisting to \u201crequired\u201d Quota Serial Numbers (QSN) and 6,000 dollars\nto those enlisting to the remaining QSNs.

BANKS/CAPT/UNIT: DC CDI TFSD QUANTICO VA/-/\nTEL: DSN 278-6045/ TEL:  COML (703) 784-6045//\nGENTEXT/REMARKS/\n1.  Per ref (a), Total Force Structure Division (TFSD) has published\nthe Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) through FY45 Tables of Organization and\nEquipment (T/O&E) and the Authorized Strength Report (ASR) data.  The\nTotal Force Structure Management System (TFSMS) was updated on 16\nJanuary 2025 and incorporates all approved changes to the Marine\nCorps force structure since the previously published T/O&E and ASR.\nThis MARADMIN cancels ref (c) and will remain in effect until the\npublication of the July 2025 T/O&E and ASR.\n2.  The ASR produces the optimal manning allocation, ensuring the\nbest distribution of personnel across the force, while attempting to\nmeet all specified constraints. TFSD produces two ASRs.\n2.a.  The Target Strength ASR, which uses the end strength mandated\nby\nthe NDAA to outline the total force structure across the Future Years\nDefense Plan (FYDP) is used for planning and programming.\n2.a.(1).  Per Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) direction, the\nfollowing Manning Precedence Levels (MPLs) are in effect for the\nTarget ASR:\nP2T2:                 Officer   100%        Enlisted    100%\nExcepted:             Officer   100%        Enlisted    100%\nIII MEF:              Officer   98%         Enlisted    99%\nInfantry Bn:          Officer   96%         Enlisted    98%\nOperating Force:      Officer   94%         Enlisted    96.5%\nEntry-Level Training: Officer   93%         Enlisted    96%\nPriority:             Officer   92%         Enlisted    93%\nPro-Share             Officer   91%         Enlisted    92%\nA list of major force structure changes incorporated within this ASR\nare available on the TFSD SharePoint website at\nhttps://usmc.sharepoint-mil.us/sites/DCCDI_TFSD/SitePages/\nAUTHORIZED-STRENGTH-REPORT.aspx\n2.b.  The Average Strength ASR, used by the Deputy Commandant for\nManpower and Reserve Affairs (DC M&RA) for staffing, averages\nstrength over a 12-month period and better reflects on-hand\ninventory.  The Average Strength is comparatively lower than the\nTarget Strength ASR, resulting in fewer manning allocations.\n2.b.(1).  T/O manning allocations reflected in TFSMS are based on the\nAverage Strength Manning Controls.\n2.b.(2).  Staffing, which refers to the portion of manning to be\nfilled with assignable inventory, is determined by staffing\nprecedence levels.  These levels may differ from the\nMPLs as they are based on the current assignable\ninventory managed by DC M&RA.   Staffing is not directly aligned with\nASR\nmanning due to personnel fluctuations.\n3.  TFSD maintains tools and resources to assist in reviewing total\nforce structure and manning allocations.  The tools are accessible on\nthe TFSD SharePoint at\nhttps://usmc.sharepoint-mil.us/sites/DCCDI_TFSD/SitePages/Page.aspx\n4.  Updated T/O&Es are available on the TFSMS website at https://\ntsms.mceits.usmc.mil.\n4.a.  Instructions for downloading current FY T/O&E report: After\nlog-in, use the Search button to enter all or part of Unit\nIdentification Code (UIC), unit name, Monitored Command Code or\nReporting Unit Code and hit Enter on your keyboard.\n4.b.  Instructions for downloading planned or future FY T/O&E\nreports:\nAfter log-in, click on \u201cReports\" link, then \u201cTFSMS Cognos Reports\nPortal.\u201d  A unit's T/O&E is located in the \"Standard Reports\n(published, structure data current as of last ASR)\" folder.  After\nentering the folder, click on \"Unit T/O&E Report\" and select the\napplicable FY and UIC.  User must enable compatibility view settings\nfor usmc.mil to select criteria for T/O&E report.\n5.  Readiness reporting.  The Defense Readiness Reporting System-\nMarine Corps (DRRS-MC) automatically populates a unit's readiness\nreport with force structure requirements from the current published\nFY TO&E resident in TFSMS.  Units should validate the force structure\nrequirements in their unit's readiness report using the current\npublished FY25 T/O&E in TFSMS or use the T/O&E link in a unit's\nreadiness\nreport in DRRS-MC.\n6.  Initiatives that require Total Force (TF) Doctrine, Organization,\nTraining/Education, Materiel, Leadership/Synchronization, Personnel,\nFacilities, & Cost Working Group (DOTMLPF-C WG) assessment in\naccordance with (IAW) ref (a) must submit the initiative topic to the\nDOTMLPF-C Secretariat no later than (NLT) 3 February 2025 for\nprioritization by Deputy Commandant, Combat Development and\nIntegration (DC CD&I).\n7.a.  Force structure initiatives that may require assessment by the\nTF DOTMLPF-C WG include, but are not limited to: unit activations,\ndeactivations, reorganizations, redesignations, relocations, and\nmajor MOS or occupational field changes.  All initiatives must have\nthree-star endorsement.  The WG will assess each initiative for\nfeasibility and supportability to inform future Force Structure\ndecisions by DC CD&I or CMC.\n7.b.  Force structure initiatives submitted for consideration by the\nTF DOTMLPF-C WG must conform to CMC planning guidance.  Initiatives\nshould be traceable to the Force Design Annual Update and/or\nshould represent formal output from a DC CDI chartered Integrated\nPlanning Team, a standing Operational Advisory Group, experimentation\nCross Functional Team output, or similar working group or advisory\nbody.\n7.c.  Contact the TF DOTMLPF-C WG Secretariat for a determination\nregarding whether the initiative will require a TF DOTMLPF-C WG\nassessment.  The secretariat will assist sponsors with preparation\nand pre-coordination of their initial brief.  Supporting\ndocumentation required for an initial brief includes but is not\nlimited to proposed T/O, Table of Equipment(T/E), and draft\nMission Statements.  All initiatives submitted for\nTF DOTMLPF-C WG assessment must be fully compensated IAW ref (a)\nchapter 5, para 3.c.(2).  The initiative sponsor is responsible for\nidentifying a structure offset(s) as part of the initiative.\n8.  Table of Organization and Equipment Change Request (TOECR)\nPolicy.\n8.a.  All TOECRs submitted for inclusion in the July 2025\nASR must be submitted to TFSD NLT Wednesday, 21 May 2025.\n8.b.  All TOECR submissions must adhere to the applicable provisions\nof ref (a).\n8.b.(1).  All TOECRs must be endorsed by the MARFOR Commander (or\napplicable Lieutenant General) IAW ref (a), chapter 9. By Direction\nauthority is not authorized.\n8.b.(2).  All TOECRs must be compensated IAW ref (a), chapter 9.\n8.c.  Additional amplifying information on TOECR submission is\nprovided below.\n8.c.(1).  Units activated or reorganized based on Force Design\ndecisions will not submit TOECRs until the action directed by MCBUL\n5400 has been reported complete.\n8.c.(2).  TOECRs submitted on UICs lacking a current Mission\nStatement (3-year renewal requirement, per ref (a)) will be returned\nwithout action, unless a Mission Statement update TOECR is submitted\nconcurrently or was previously submitted and is in processing.\n8.c.(3).  IAW ref (a), Military Manpower TOECRs will be programmed\nfor the out-years and must align with future assignment planning\ncycles.  TOECRs for the July 2025 ASR should be planned for execution\nno earlier than FY28. Requests for execution before FY28 will be\nreturned without action.\n8.c.(4).  Civilian Manpower TOECRs:  IAW ref (a), chapter 9, para\n9.c., all term positions must be fully documented on the T/O for the\nfull term duration.  TOECRs that do not meet the criteria set forth\nby ref (a) will be returned without action.\n8.c.(5).  External assignments by Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).  All\nTOECRs for external Marine assignments, including those to joint or\nother agencies and organizations, must include a signed MOA between\nthe Marine Corps and the supported organization(s). According to ref\n(a), DC CD&I holds signature authority for executing these\nagreements. Before submitting the TOECR, the MOA should be\ncoordinated, formatted, and staffed with DC CD&I (Attention: TFSD)\nfor pre-coordination.  After coordination, submit the final MOA\npackage to DC CD&I via Enterprise Task Management Software Solution\n(ETMS2) for signature.  Once fully executed, attach the MOA to the\nTOECR and submit it via TFSMS.\n8.c.(6).  TFSD maintains the title Navy Manpower Budget Submitting\nOffice (BSO-27) and oversees all Navy Manpower in Support of Marine\nCorps (NMISOMC) missions, previously known as Blue in Support of\nGreen (BISOG). This involves validating Navy structure and enlisted\nmanning, aligning available Navy funding with USMC priorities,\nadvocating for high-demand, low-density Navy personnel, coordinating\nstaffing and managing billet adjustments.  Coordination with BSO-27\nis\nrequired for any TOCER that impacts or requires changes to NMISOMC\nstructure.

The board will consider CWOs serving in \nan active status for promotion in Other Than Active Reserve (OTAR)\nand Active Reserve (AR) competitive categories by military \noccupational specialty (MOS).  CWOs identified as Reserve \nActive-Status List (RASL) in reference (b) are in OTAR competitive\ncategories.  The OTAR selection boards will consider officers\nfor promotion to the grades of CWO5, CWO4, and CWO3 if vacancies\nbecome available in the OTAR MOS competitive categories in these \ngrades.  CWOs identified as AR in reference (b) are in AR \ncompetitive categories.  The AR selection boards will consider \nofficers for promotion to the grades of CWO5, CWO4, and CWO3 if \nvacancies become available in the AR MOS competitive categories in\nthe AR program in these grades.\nThe AR MOS competitive categories are:\n    A.  Personnel Officer (MOS 0170)\n    B.  Aircraft Maintenance Engineer Officer (MOS 6004)\n    C.  Aviation Ordnance Officer (MOS 6502)\n2. Promotion Board.  The board will consider three categories of\nofficers as specified by the yearly promotion plan:  Above-Zone, \nIn-Zone, and Below-Zone.  Officers identified as RASL or AR in \nreference (b) are eligible for their respective board if, on the \nconvening date of the board, the officers have continuously \nperformed service on either the RASL or the Active-Duty List (or a \ncombination of both lists) for a period of one year.  However, \nofficers whose established date for removal from the RASL is within\n90 days after the date the board is convened will not be considered \nby the board.  Officers whose lineal control number (LCN) precedes \nthe senior officer In-Zone are defined as Above-Zone.  Those Above-\nZone officers who have not been previously considered are defined as\n\"Above-Zone, not previously considered.\"  Officers in this status \nare considered by the board to be In-Zone.  Officers may review \nreference (b) and their eligibility for the board on the internet \nat the officer promotion homepage.

In accordance with Public Law 98-144 (1983), \nthe third Monday of January is designated as a federal holiday to \nhonor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. This year, we \ncommemorate his life and achievements on Monday, January 20, 2025. \nIn observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, this year\u2019s theme, \n\u201cExcellence in Action,\u201d honors the legacy of nonviolent \ndemonstrators who fought to address the injustices faced by Black \nAmericans and other minorities.\n2.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 marked a pivotal moment in the \nfight against racial discrimination and segregation, with \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. calling it a \"second emancipation.\" \nThe Act desegregated public facilities, schools, and addressed \ndiscriminatory voting practices, while prohibiting discrimination \nin employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or \nnational origin. The civil rights movement faced violent \nopposition, epitomized by the brutal attack on activists during the \n1965 \"Bloody Sunday\" march in Selma, Alabama. This tragic event \ngalvanized the nation in its fight against racial injustice. \nDr. King\u2019s leadership, culminating in the successful 1965 \nSelma-to-Montgomery march and subsequent passage of the \nVoting Rights Act and Fair Housing Act, is symbolized in this \nyear\u2019s commemorative poster, which honors his enduring commitment \nto equality and justice. The poster is found on the Defense Equal \nOpportunity Management Institute website: https://www.deomi.mil/\nSpecial-Observances/#martin-luther-king-jr-birthday.\n3.  In observance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, commanders are \nencouraged to honor his legacy by organizing programs and \nactivities that celebrate his contributions. Participation in local \ncommunity events and unit-level observances is strongly encouraged, \nfostering reflection on the ideals Dr. King championed and their \ncontinued significance to our mission and values.\n4.

Per references (a) and (b), Suicide\nPrevention is a priority for the Department of Defense (DoD), the\nUnited States Marine Corps, and the Integrated Primary Prevention\nWorkforce.  Lethal Means Safety (LMS) is an effective and\nevidence-based method for saving lives.  Reducing access to lethal\nmeans during times of crisis reduces the risk of suicide and other\ntragic outcomes.  Defense Suicide Prevention Office (DSPO)\ncontracted CNA (formerly Center for Naval Analyses) to conduct\nstudies of LMS within DoD military services.\n2.  To ensure future LMS initiatives are informed by Marines\u2019 needs\nand perspectives, Marine and Family Programs Division (MF) is\ncoordinating with CNA to conduct an LMS survey of Marines.  The\nsurvey explores Marines\u2019 awareness of current LMS programs,\npreferences for safety devices and storage locations, and\nconsiderations for LMS messaging specific to Marine Corps culture.\n3.  This survey is sponsored by DSPO and is administered by CNA.\nDSPO and MF are exploring how LMS outreach efforts are implemented\nand whether these efforts are reaching Marines.\n4.  The survey is currently open and closes on 31 January 2025.\nParticipation is voluntary and the survey should take less than 15\nminutes.  No names, contact information, or any other personally\nidentifiable information will be collected in the survey.\n5.  Marines interested in participating can access the survey at\nhttps:(slash)(slash)cnaorg.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_38L0FHrDBa\nBpuES.\n6.

COUTU/GS-14/BRANCH HEAD MCSRB/PSD/TECOM/\nEMAIL:JAY.COUTU@USMC.MIL//\nGENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  Per reference (a), in accordance with the CMC\nForce Design 2030 Annual Update from June 2023, the Deputy\nCommandant for Combat Development and Integration (DC CD&I) and\nDeputy Commandant for Aviation (DCA) were tasked to institutionalize\nthe Multifunction Air Operations Center (MAOC) for the service\nthrough the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership,\nPersonnel, Facilities, and Cost (DOTMLPF-C) process.  In August of\n2024, the 39th Commandant provided a letter to the Deputy Commandant\nfor Aviation with additional guidance for all things pertaining to\nMarine aviation.  From this letter, a specific task was issued to\ncontinue implementation of MAOC in coordination with adjacent\nheadquarters stakeholders.  In accordance with CMC direction and\nguidance, DCA established a MAOC Transition Task Force (TTF) Charter\nto manage the associated DOTMLPF-C initiatives required to\ninstitutionalize MAOC for the service.  Initiative one, has been\nestablished as the merger of the 7236 and 7242 enlisted Military\nOccupational Specialty (MOS) as well as the 7208 and 7210 officer\nMOS.  Initiative two, has been established as the reorganization of\nthe Marine Air Control Group (MACG) in support the MAOC concept in\nwhich the MOS merger sets conditions to execute the MACG\nreorganization.  In October 2024, initiative one underwent a\nDOTMLPF-C working group analysis resulting in a unanimous low-risk,\nsupportable assessment by the DOTMLPF-C pillars, reference (d).  The\nend state is to modernize the Marine Air Command and Control System\n(MACCS) for the service through the merger of air support and air\ndefense MOSs to create common multifunction air command and control\n(AC2) Marines in support of the MAOC.  Combining these fields seeks\nto provide the MAGTF with gains in efficiency via better trained and\nmore capable AC2 Marines able to support all functions of aviation\nwhile enabling the service to retain talent IAW reference (b).\n2.  In coordination with Manpower & Reserve Affairs (M&RA), Training\nand Education Command (TECOM), and Combat Development and\nIntegration (CD&I), the below changes are reflected in the FY26 MOS\nManual.\n3.  Marines with the PMOS 7236 and 7242 will be recoded to PMOS 7240\n(Tactical Air Control Operator) on 1 October 2025.  Marines with the\nPMOS 7208 and 7210 will be recoded to PMOS 7209 (Air Command and\nControl Officer) on 1 October 2025. The Table of Organization and\nEquipment Change Request (TOECR) was approved and is reflected in\nthe January 2025 ASR.\n4.  M&RA (MMIB) will report unit diary entries to convert active\ncomponent Marines with PMOS 7236 or 7242 to PMOS 7240, and PMOS 7208\nor 7210 to PMOS 7209.  These Marines will be identified in a\nreclassification spreadsheet provided by the (72XX) Occupational\nField Sponsor to MMIB.  Reserve Affairs Management will convert\nreserve component Marines with PMOS 7236 or 7242 to PMOS 7240, and\nPMOS 7208 or 7210 to PMOS 7209.  No action is required by the\nindividual Marine.\n5.  Training\n5.a.  Entry Level Training (ELT)\n5.a.1.  NLT 1 October 2025, all prospective 7240 and 7209 PMOS ELT\nstudents will attend either the enlisted Tactical Air Control\nOperator Course M0972B1 or Air Command and Control Officer Course\nM096871.\n5.b.  Legacy 7236, 7242, 7208, and 7210 PMOS Training\n5.b.1.  All ELT students that attend ELT training in CY25 under\nlegacy course identification codes for the Tactical Air Defense\nController Course M0972P1, Air Support Operations Operator Course\nM0967L1, Air Support Control Officers Course M09T0A1, and Air\nDefense Control Officer Course M0972M1 will have completed MAOC\npilot course curriculum meeting new PMOS training requirements.\nThese Marines will be granted their new PMOS on 1 October 2025 and\nassigned to duty stations based on the current ASR.\n5.b.2.  All 7236 and 7242 Marines holding the rank of Gunnery\nSergeant or above will be exempt from any additional training\nrequirements to be granted the PMOS of 7240. All 7236 and 7242\nMarines holding a qualification of Crew Chief or above will be\nexempt from any additional training requirements to be granted the\nPMOS of 7240.  All 7208 and 7210 Marines holding a qualification of\nSenior Air Director or above will be exempt from any additional\ntraining requirements to be granted the PMOS of 7209.  All other\nMarines not meeting these requirements will be tracked by a draw\ncase code and be required to complete local unit transition training\nto remove the draw case code from their new PMOS designation.\n5.b.3.  Local unit transition training will be accomplished via a\ncombination of contracted Mobile Training Teams (MTT) and unit\nWeapons and Tactics Instructors that will provide a\nTrain-the-Trainer (T3) period of instruction to establish an initial\nuniformed cadre of trainers at each applicable unit.  Once trained,\nuniformed trainers at each unit will continue to provide the\nrequisite transition training to those Marines with a draw case\ncode.  A certificate of transition training completion will be\ngenerated and endorsed by the local unit commander and provided to\neach trained Marine for their record as the method to track\ntransition training completion.  Those local units will produce\ntraining rosters of no less than 20 Marines with their associated\ntraining certificates, to be routed and consolidated at the O-6\nlevel and submitted to the Occupational Field Sponsors (POC 1, 2,\nand 3) for reconciliation and submission for removal of the draw\ncase code, signaling completion of transition training.  The\ndeadline to complete and submit record of transition training\ncompletion is one year from the establishment of local unit trainer\ncadre by the MTT and/or one year from a Marine designated with a\ndraw case code reporting to an affected unit with trained cadre.\n6.  The above changes are effective as of release of this message\nand are reflected in the FY26 update to reference (C).\n7.  This MARADMIN is applicable to the Marine Corps Total Force.\n8.  Any questions should be directed to POC 1, 2, or 3 as indicated\nabove.\n9.  Release authorized by LtGen Bradford J. Gering, Deputy\nCommandant for Aviation.//"

Under the provisions of section 578 of ref (a) and ref (c), the\nSecretary of the Navy, acting for the President of the United\nStates, hereby authorizes the promotion of the following named\nregular officer(s) as indicated, to the permanent grade of Chief\nWarrant Officer Five (CWO5) through Chief Warrant Officer Three\n(CWO3).  Rank, pay, and allowances are effective from 1 June 2025.\nName                            Grade        MCC\nAnthony D. Siani                CWO5         1EM\nMatthew H.

Delay of Promotion\n6.a.  Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (h), if the\nrespective commanding officer determines that an officer is not\nmentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for\npromotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the\nphysical examination requirement for reserve officers per section\n10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the\nofficer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the\nappointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the\nnotice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers\nmust also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the\nappointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps\nTotal Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of\nadministrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain \nguidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.\n6.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this\npromotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or\npotentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)\nremoved the names of those officers with records identified during\nthe adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially\nadverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN. Those\nofficers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC\n(JPL).\n7.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary\nretirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to\nacceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion\ncarries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with\naugmentation into the regular component.\n8.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve\nofficer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have\naccepted such promotion on the effective date contained in\nparagraphs 2 through 5 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and\nallowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion,\nan officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC\n(MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their\npromotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the\nnext higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which\nsignals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their\nright to decline.\n9.  The following FY25 promotions are projected for July 2025 and\nare subject to change.  Promotions from the remaining FY25 boards\nwill be promulgated based on vacancy determination and senate\nconfirmation.\n            Senior Officer        Sel    Junior Officer        Sel\nCol (R)     J.
